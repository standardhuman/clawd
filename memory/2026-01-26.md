## Blisscapes Website - V1 to V2

Client: Noah (garden/landscaping business)
Project location: `~/AI/business/clients/blisscapes/`
Live site: https://blisscapes.briancline.co
Feedback: https://blisscapes.briancline.co/feedback.html

### V2 Changes Implemented (from V1 feedback)
- Logo size increased (80→100px mobile, 100→120px desktop)
- "Bay Area Climate" → "Bay Area" copy change
- Replaced icons: installations (beaker→wrench), low water (cube→droplet), pollinator (heart→flower)
- Fixed mobile header spacing (hero cut off)
- Added 4 photos to gallery (flagstone patio, Noah working, water feature, boulder installation)
- Removed 2 photos (cacti/wooden wall, stepping stone path with truck)
- Fixed lightbox gallery array to match actual photos (was showing 9/9 instead of 11/11)
- Fixed lightbox nav buttons hidden on mobile (changed to position:fixed with z-index)

### Technical Fixes
- Feedback form wasn't submitting: field name mismatch between form and API
- Added RESEND_API_KEY to Vercel env
- Changed email sender to onboarding@resend.dev (Resend sandbox)
- Removed briancline.io references (should be .co)

### Version Control Setup
- V1 archived at `/v1.html`
- Feedback page updated to show V2 current, V1 archived
- Progress bar updated to reflect V2 phase

## SailorSkills - Customer Boundary

Brian received a text asking for ballpark pricing on topside washing without the person giving their name or slip #. Person was pushy ("need a number today or tomorrow").

Brian's values:
- Relationships and community connection matter (lived in Berkeley Marina 16 years)
- Every boat varies in complexity - custom quotes only
- Wants to know who he's speaking with

Helped draft polite but firm boundary-setting responses that explain *why* he needs to see the boat without caving to pressure.
