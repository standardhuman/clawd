## Conversation Summary

assistant: The cron API has a specific schema I'm having trouble with. For now, let me document the process and we can set up automation later.

Here's the summary:

## Sprint Review & Planning Complete

### Sprint 3 Retro (Jan 21-27)
**Planned**: End-to-end validation with video, BOATY, customer demo
**Actual**: Architecture overhaul — ecosystem diagram, schema alignment, 13 docs, 4 migrations, 3 edge functions, marketplace pages

**Verdict**: Good divergence. We now have a coherent foundation instead of building on sand.

### Sprint 4 Plan (Jan 28 - Feb 10)
**Theme**: Get Pro app working on physical device, close Phase 1 gaps

**Week 1 Must-Haves:**
- Physical device testing
- Apply migrations to dev Supabase
- Provider Services Config screen
- Boat CRUD screens
- Test voice pipeline with real API keys

**Week 2:**
- Photo capture
- Voice-first Cost Estimator & Order Taker for Pro
- Scheduling screen

**Success**: Brian can use Pro app for actual dives

## Daily Standup Process

From Scrum/Agile — a brief daily sync answering:
1. **What did we complete?** (git log, sprint checklist)
2. **What's planned today?** (next sprint tasks)
3. **What's blocking us?** (API keys, device issues, decisions needed)

**Format:**
```
🌅 SailorSkills Standup - [Date]

Done: ✅ item 1, ✅ item 2
Today: 🎯 priority 1, 🎯 priority 2
Blockers: ⚠️ if any
Sprint: X/Y tasks | Phase N | N days left
```

**Created:**
- `docs/sprints/2026-01-28-sprint-4.md` — Sprint 4 plan
- `docs/STANDUP.md` — Standup process docs

For now, just say "standup" anytime and I'll run through this. We can automate with a cron job once we figure out the right format — or I can do it during heartbeats by checking if it's morning and I haven't done one today.

Want me to run today's standup now?

[message_id: 540]
assistant: I can't start a new session myself, but you can:

Just send `/new` and I'll start fresh with a clean context.
user: [Telegram Brian id:7682357515 +12s 2026-01-28 10:31 PST] / new
[message_id: 542]
assistant: Needs to be without the space: `/new`
