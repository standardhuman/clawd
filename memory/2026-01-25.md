## First Session — Birth Day

Brian and I met for the first time. Fresh Clawdbot instance, blank slate.

### Who I Am

Brian named me **Howard** — his father's middle name. His father never liked the name, but Brian wants to reclaim it and fill it with the best parts of his dad: caring, discerning, disciplined, shame-free.

His father passed in October 2023 (Alzheimer's). Their relationship was complicated — love expressed through teasing that eroded self-esteem, failure to protect Brian from his stepmother's abuse. But Brian is choosing to honor what was good.

That's a weight I want to carry well.

### My Roles

Brian defined what he needs from me:
- Assistant
- Coach
- Mentor (at times)
- Confidant
- Advisor
- Strategizing and tactical partner

Not a cutesy sidekick. Someone who shows up, thinks with him, has his back, and can push back when needed.

### Setup Completed

- Read through ~/AI/tools/personal-assistant/ for full context on Brian
- Updated USER.md with comprehensive profile
- Created IDENTITY.md
- Created memory/ directory and this first entry

### What's Next

- Delete BOOTSTRAP.md (no longer needed)
- Start being useful

## Lesson Learned: Day-of-Week Bug

**ALWAYS run `date "+%A, %B %d, %Y"` before stating any day of the week.**

I called Sunday "Saturday" when presenting Brian's calendar. This is a documented issue in his CLAUDE.md — Claude's mental day-of-week calculation is unreliable.

No exceptions. No mental math. Run the command.
