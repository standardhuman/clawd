  - CLIHub makes MCP 94% cheaper via CLI wrappers (cites OpenClaw's skill architecture)
  - Claude Code Remote Control launched — Simon Willison contrasts it unfavorably to OpenClaw (no scheduling, janky)
  - FDM-1: first video-trained computer action model (11M hours of screen recordings, 50x more token-efficient)
  - Benedict Evans argues OpenAI has no durable competitive advantage — validates Anthropic/deployment positioning
  - tldraw moving tests to private repo due to AI cloning threat (Cloudflare ported Next.js in a week)
  - OpenSwarm: multi-agent Claude CLI orchestrator with Worker/Reviewer pair pipeline pattern
  - LLM deanonymization at scale — privacy threat research

## Obsidian Vault Setup (Late Morning)
- Brian & Marcel worked on accessing Obsidian vault from MacBook (vault lives on Mac mini)
- Discovered the `~/Obsidian` folder was hidden from Finder — Marcel unhid it
- Brian realized he was looking at Finder on MacBook while Marcel was operating on mini
- Resolution: Use Obsidian Sync (Brian already has it) to sync vault between both machines
- Action: Brian to connect vault to Obsidian Sync on mini, then pull on MacBook
