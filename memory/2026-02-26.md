## Noa Research Brief
- **Report:** `reports/2026-02-26-research.md`
- **Key findings:**
  - CLIHub makes MCP 94% cheaper via CLI wrappers (cites OpenClaw's skill architecture)
  - Claude Code Remote Control launched — Simon Willison contrasts it unfavorably to OpenClaw (no scheduling, janky)
  - FDM-1: first video-trained computer action model (11M hours of screen recordings, 50x more token-efficient)
  - Benedict Evans argues OpenAI has no durable competitive advantage — validates Anthropic/deployment positioning
  - tldraw moving tests to private repo due to AI cloning threat (Cloudflare ported Next.js in a week)
  - OpenSwarm: multi-agent Claude CLI orchestrator with Worker/Reviewer pair pipeline pattern
  - LLM deanonymization at scale — privacy threat research
  - Google API keys silently gained Gemini access — 2,863 affected keys in Common Crawl

## BuildZig Client Work (Morning)
- Marcel created full client package in Obsidian: `SailorSkills/Business/Clients/BuildZig/`
  - Meeting Notes, Questionnaire, Post-Call Notes, Proposal, Email Draft
  - Files created 9:26–11:04 AM
- New SailorSkills consulting prospect — docs prepared for follow-up

## Obsidian Vault Setup (Late Morning)
- Brian & Marcel worked on accessing Obsidian vault from MacBook (vault lives on Mac mini)
- Discovered the `~/Obsidian` folder was hidden from Finder — Marcel unhid it
- Brian realized he was looking at Finder on MacBook while Marcel was operating on mini
- Resolution: Use Obsidian Sync (Brian already has it) to sync vault between both machines
- Action: Brian to connect vault to Obsidian Sync on mini, then pull on MacBook

## Notion Client Setup — Glass Slipper (Evening)
- Created full Notion entry for **Glass Slipper** (Cree Partridge) in Diving Client List

  - Glass Slipper Admin (inline database — Date, Time In, Time Out, Duration)
  - Glass Slipper Service Log (⚓ child page)
  - Glass Slipper Conditions (inline database inside Service Log — Date, Growth, Paint, Anodes, Notes)
- Discovered `~/.config/notion/api_key` is stale; working token is in `$NOTION_API_TOKEN` env var
- Used Esprit de Métisier as template for the new entry structure

## Evening Debrief

## Noa Research Brief (Late Night — for Feb 27)

- Greg Isenberg testing Perplexity Computer ($200/mo) as persistent founder agent — OpenClaw competitor for non-technical segment
