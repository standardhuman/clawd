## Email Infrastructure Setup — Resend

### Decision
Resend is the email platform for all domains. Evaluated alternatives (SES, Postmark, SendGrid) — Resend wins on DX, pricing, and simplicity at Brian's scale.

### Architecture
- **All transactional email** (invoices, service reports, magic links, etc.) sends from `notifications@sailorskills.com`
- **Multi-provider model**: `From: "Jake's Diving via SailorSkills" <notifications@sailorskills.com>` with `Reply-To: provider's personal email`
- No per-provider email setup needed — scales to hundreds of divers
- Supabase auth emails should be pointed to Resend SMTP (not done yet)

### Plan & Cost
- Upgraded to **Pro ($20/mo)** — 50K emails/mo, 10 domains, no daily limit
- Current volume: ~200 emails/mo. Free tier would've worked for a while, but needed multiple domains.

### Domain Status
| Domain | Resend Status | DNS Provider | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| sailorskills.com | ✅ Verified | Vercel | Was already set up. Old Mailgun records on root domain can be cleaned up. |
| briancline.co | ✅ Verified | Vercel | DNS records added via Vercel CLI today. All 3 records confirmed. |
| needsarenormal.com | ⏳ Pending DNS | Squarespace (transferring to Vercel) | Domain added to Resend, transfer code requested. Brian will share code when it arrives. |

### Resend DNS Records (same pattern for each domain)
1. TXT: `resend._domainkey` → DKIM public key
2. MX: `send` subdomain → `feedback-smtp.us-east-1.amazonses.com` (priority 10)
3. TXT: `send` subdomain → `v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all`

### API Keys (9 exist in Resend)
- sailor-skills-pro, booking-system, SailorSkills-Marketing, intake.sailorskills.com, ant, tmc-test, Supabase Auth Emails, TMC Resources for Women, sailorskills
- Should consolidate and store in 1Password

### Still TODO
- [x] Transfer needsarenormal.com to Vercel — **initiated 2/11**, Squarespace side completes ~Feb 16
- [ ] Point Supabase auth SMTP to Resend
- [ ] Clean up old Mailgun SPF/MX records on root sailorskills.com
- [ ] Consolidate Resend API keys into 1Password
- [ ] Send test email from briancline.co to verify end-to-end

## Brian's Marine Insurance Policy — Reviewed for Sarah Hiring

### Policy Details
- **Carrier:** RLI Insurance Company
- **Policy #:** EMA0103560
- **Period:** 05/31/2025 – 05/31/2026
- **Premium:** $2,422/year
- **Agent:** Mariners General Insurance Group, 206 Riverside Ave Suite A, Newport Beach, CA 92663
- **Named Insured:** Brian Cline DBA: Sailor Skills, LLC
- **Business Description:** Marine Artisan / Ship Repairer

### Coverage Summary
| Coverage | Limit |
|---|---|
| Each Occurrence (Combined Single Limit) | $1,000,000 |
| General Aggregate | $2,000,000 |
| Products/Completed Ops Aggregate | $1,000,000 |
| Personal & Advertising Injury Aggregate | $1,000,000 |
| Damage to Premises Rented | $50,000 |
| Medical Expense | $5,000 |
| Deductible (per occurrence) | $2,500 |
| Pollution deductible | $2,500 |

### Three Coverage Parts
1. **Marine General Liability (OMGL 102)** — standard GL for marine artisan operations
2. **Watercraft Repairers Liability (OMGL 112)** — covers damage to boats in your care, custody, control while being repaired
3. **Marine Equipment Floater (OMP 652)** — covers your own equipment

### Key Finding: Employee Endorsement (OMGL 651) — 1099 Focus
The policy has a specific endorsement extending "employee" definition to **1099 workers**, requiring either:
- Signed employment application indicating 1099 payment, OR
- Actual 1099 payment
- Plus must meet FLSA employee standards

**This endorsement was written for 1099 contractors, not W-2 employees.** Brian needs to tell his broker about the W-2 change.

### What the Policy Covers for Sarah (as employee)
- ✅ Damage Sarah causes to **client boats** → Watercraft Repairers Liability
- ✅ Third-party bodily injury or property damage from her work → Marine GL
- ✅ She's an insured for acts within scope of employment (General Conditions A.2.a)

### What the Policy Does NOT Cover
- ❌ **Sarah's own on-the-job injuries** — excluded under Workers' Comp exclusion (Section II.D) and Employer's Liability exclusion (Section II.E)
- ❌ Any WC, Jones Act, USL&H, maritime law obligations

### Key Clarification: Hull Cleaning ≠ Ship Repair (Maritime Law)
- Sarah will NOT be working aboard vessels or repairing them — she dives **under moored boats** to remove growth
- Vessels are **never underway** during work — stationary at berths in marinas
- This is arguably **maintenance/janitorial**, not "ship repair" under the Longshore Act
- **USL&H may not apply** — standard CA state workers' comp could be sufficient
- Standard CA WC rates (~$2–$4/$100 payroll) vs maritime rates (~$9–$10/$100) = massive cost difference
- **Estimated WC cost if standard state act applies: ~$770–$1,920/year** vs ~$3,500–$4,800 for maritime

### Action Items for Brian
- [x] ~~Email Mariners General Insurance Group~~ — **SENT 2/11/2026** — asked about:
  1. Updating Employee Endorsement (OMGL 651) from 1099 to W-2
  2. Whether USL&H is needed or standard CA state WC is sufficient for hull cleaning divers
  3. Premium impact of adding W-2 employee
- [ ] **Awaiting broker response** on endorsement update + WC guidance
- [ ] **Sarah does NOT need her own Marine GL** for SailorSkills work — she's covered under Brian's policy as his employee

### Sarah's Independent Work
If Sarah does boat work **outside** of SailorSkills (independently), she would need her own marine contractor GL policy for that work. Brian's policy only covers work done on his behalf.

## Obsidian Dashboard — Phase 1 Built

### What was created
- **`Dashboard.md`** in Brian's Vault root — central status view across all workstreams
- Sections: Needs Attention, SailorSkills Pro, Sarah Onboarding, Taxes/Finance, Email Infra, Infrastructure, Upcoming
- Updated stale **MVP Tracker** to match reality (was showing 0%, actual is ~85%)

### How it gets updated
- Howard updates during normal conversations (no cron, no automation)
- Brian says "good morning" or "update dashboard" to trigger refresh
- No new plugins needed for Phase 1 (pure markdown + status indicators)

### Phase 2 completed (same day!)
- Installed Dataview + Charts Obsidian plugins
- Added YAML frontmatter to Employee Expansion docs + MVP Tracker (project, status, type, updated)
- Dashboard now uses Dataview queries: auto-lists project files, shows status, sorts by last updated
- Still TODO: sync script to pull git commits and beads issues into Obsidian notes for Dataview

### Cron Cleanup
- Removed 3 broken context-monitor cron jobs (were failing due to missing anthropic-direct API key)
- Heartbeats still active (every 30 min, lightweight)
- HEARTBEAT.md kept empty to minimize API usage

### Sarah Decided to Postpone (Late Night 2/11)
- Sarah texted Brian at 12:21 AM saying she needs to shelve the diving venture for now
- Needs stable income to rebuild financial reserves first
- Wants to revisit in a few months when she has more financial security
- Brian responded with compassion and gratitude — door left open
- **Key insight from Brian:** The whole process of exploring this was valuable — pushed him deep into business financials, insurance, compensation structures. He's in a much better position of awareness going forward.

### TOS Discussion
- Brian concerned about automated API patterns with OAuth token
- Agreed: no cron jobs for now, heartbeats are fine (lightweight), briefings happen in-conversation
- Dashboard updates happen naturally during work, not on a schedule
