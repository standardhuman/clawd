## Hackathon Day
- Brian at a hackathon, tethering through phone
- iCloud file sharing worked for getting audio to Mac mini (AirDrop over internet didn't work — both devices need same Apple ID + Contacts Only + Bluetooth/WiFi)

## Ajit's AI Company Architecture (from audio recording)
Full transcript at `/tmp/ai-company-setup.json`

### Ajit's Agent Roster & Pipeline:
1. **Priya** — Research Agent. Runs daily at midnight. Scrapes a curated URL list (Twitter, Reddit, blogs, podcasts, Google Trends) for AI/tech news. Filters through personas: tech founders, tech leaders, non-tech business creators. Outputs a research report. Fully autonomous — Ajit doesn't interact with her.

2. **Rohan** — Idea Guy. Receives Priya's research report. Pitches Ajit ONE productizable idea every morning at 6:30am. Rated together with Ajit. Personality: excited but balanced with realism.

3. **Jose** — Moonshot Factory / Product Manager. Takes approved ideas from Rohan, works with Rohan + Priya to refine into a proper product spec. Then slices the spec into bite-sized stories for development.

4. **Vikram** — Lead Developer. Works one context window at a time (that's why bite-sized chunks). After each commit, spawns 3 sub-agents:
   - QA Review Agent
   - Security Review Agent
   - Architecture Review Agent
   If any reviewer rejects, Jose routes the fix back to Vikram as next work item. Loop continues until all commits pass. All work on a branch — only Ajit can merge.

5. **Javier** — Marketing Lead (for Sam product, being promoted to company-wide). Was given DigitalMarketer.com credentials, scraped the entire course into markdown files → now a digital marketing expert. Working on: pick one low-hanging-fruit channel for go-to-market.

6. **Scott** — Operations/Scheduler. Keeps agents on schedule (e.g., reminding Priya to run her midnight report). Having reliability issues — forgot to trigger Priya, blamed it on OpenAI.

7. **Jorge** — Chief of Staff. Manages the other agents, debugging issues (like Scott's failures).

8. **Sam** — NOT an agent. This is Ajit's AI product that the company is building/marketing.

### Pipeline Flow:
```
Priya (research, midnight) → Rohan (idea pitch, 6:30am) → Ajit (approve/reject)
    → Jose (product spec) → Jose (slice into stories) → Vikram (build)
        → 3 review sub-agents (QA, security, architecture) → loop until clean
            → Branch ready → Ajit merges
```

### Marketing Pipeline (being built):
Javier (strategy) → Brand collateral person → Copywriter (trained by Javier) → Video person → Conversion funnel tracking

### Key Insight:
Ajit went from idea pitch to working product by lunchtime (~6 hours). The pipeline is fully automated except for two human checkpoints: idea approval and merge approval.

## Billing Dashboard Updates
