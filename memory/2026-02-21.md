## SailorSkills Pro
- Brian tested Build 42 on TestFlight — follow-up tasks UI working!
- Screenshot: Approve Job screen shows "Install anodes" follow-up with items_needed chips
- Feedback: no save confirmation details, no email/invoice buttons, follow-up badges not showing on home screen
- **Migration 029 applied** — `follow_up_tasks` table now live in Supabase production
- Fixed: save snackbar now shows cost + media count + follow-up count
- Fixed: `pendingByBoat` stale closure in HomeScreen `renderItem` deps
- Fixed: `refreshFollowUps()` added to useFocusEffect for badge refresh
- **Build 43** compiled and uploaded to TestFlight (CFBundleVersion=43)
- IPA: `build-1771728638089.ipa`

## SailorSkills Marketplace
- **Provider cards linked to detail pages** — ServiceLocation.tsx cards wrapped in `<Link to="/provider/:id">`
  - Phone/website/maps buttons use stopPropagation
  - ServiceProviderListView already had links (verified)
- **Sitemap expanded** — 93 → ~620 URLs (added all ~530 provider detail pages)
  - generate-sitemap.mjs now fetches provider IDs from Supabase API
- **Boat owner portal enhanced:**
  - NextServiceCard: estimates next cleaning from service history intervals
  - GrowthTrendChart: CSS bar chart showing biofouling trend over last 8 services
  - ServiceLogDetail: added Recommendations section (ready for Pro's owner-facing data)
- **Request Quote flow built:**
  - RequestQuoteDialog component on ProviderDetail sidebar
  - quote_requests table migration written (not yet applied — needs DB access)
  - Statuses: pending → contacted → quoted → closed
- **Admin Quotes page** at /admin/quotes
  - Lists all quote requests with one-click status progression
  - Direct email/phone links for quick follow-up
- **ProviderProfile dashboard** already wired to real Supabase (discovered it was done, not mock)
