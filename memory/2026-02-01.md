## Memory System Investigation

**Issue discovered:** OpenClaw's memory search isn't working because OpenAI embeddings API hit quota (429 error). Sessions were never indexed (0/1125).

- Brian's screenshot confirmed config is correct (memorySearch section properly configured)
- The embeddings calls are failing silently
- Need to either: top up OpenAI credits OR switch to alternative embedding provider

**Impact:** When context fills and compaction happens, no summary survives → I lose memory of conversations. This happened multiple times today (5 compactions).

## CIR Course (Communication Impact and Relationships)

- Brian is taking this course, starts **February 4, 2026**
- We discussed storing course materials in `~/clawd/courses/cir/`
- Course materials not yet available - Brian will share when he gets access
- Had a longer discussion about this earlier that was lost to compaction

## Session Notes

- Heavy session with many compactions (hit 97% context at 194k/200k tokens)
- Searched through old session files trying to recover lost context
- Found sessions from Jan 25-31 with various topics (calendar events, handoff/resume skills, voice memo testing)

## Action Items

- [ ] Fix memory indexing (OpenAI quota or switch providers)
- [ ] Store CIR course materials when Brian gets access (Feb 4+)
