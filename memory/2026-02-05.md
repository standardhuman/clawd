## SailorSkills Order Data Architecture

**Key discovery**: Order data is split across multiple Supabase tables:
- `boats` — boat details only (no service interval)
- `service_orders` — includes `service_interval` 
- `service_schedules` — for recurring, includes `interval_months`
- `customer_services` — includes `frequency`, `service_type`, `base_price`, `notes`

**To find a customer's service frequency**: Check `customer_services` table, not `boats`.
