# 2026-02-09 — Big Session: Employee Revenue Model, IRS Response, CPA Search

## SailorSkills Employee Expansion — Sarah

### Revenue Model Built
- Pulled all 92 active boats from Notion with intervals, durations, pricing
- **Current baseline:** ~43 services/month avg, ~$6,400/month revenue, $149 avg/service
- January 2026 was a peak month ($9,632 / 52 boats) — NOT representative
- Interval distribution: 14 monthly, 34 bimonthly, 33 quarterly, 1 quad, 5 semi-annual

### Key Finding: $4K/$4K Target
- Regardless of rev share %, need **~54 total services/month** for both to earn $4K
- That's 11 more/month than current avg — requires ~25-35 new clients over the year
- At 50/50, employee needs to do ALL 54 boats for her $4K (heavy load)
- At 70/30 (her favor), she needs 38 boats — more achievable

### Ramp-Up Plan Created
- 5 phases: Training (Mar) → Supervised (Apr) → Growing (May) → Independent (Jun) → Full (Jul+)
- Duration data: avg 36 min/boat (Brian's pace), Sarah estimated 2x initially
- Brian's workload: ~26 hrs/month in-water for 46 boats

### Hybrid Compensation Model (Recommended)
- $2,000 base + 35% commission = ~$4,100/month at full capacity (40 boats)
- Sarah hits $4K by September 2026 with moderate growth
- Brian stays $4,500-5,500/month

### Referral Commission
- Sarah countered Brian's 10% with 25% PERPETUAL — way above industry norms
- Industry standard: flat $50-150 one-time or 5-15% of first service only
- Recommendation: 10% for 12 months (not perpetual), or 15%/12mo as compromise
- 25% perpetual on monthly client = $447/year FOREVER for one dock conversation

## IRS S-Corp Response (Letter dated Jan 30, 2026)

### S-Corp Election: ACCEPTED but NOT retroactive to 2024
- **Effective date: January 1, 2025** (not 2024 as hoped)
- Ref: 0424548755, LTR 385C, EIN 92-0717138
- Reason for no retroactive: 1120-S forms not timely filed
- Can apply for Private Letter Ruling (PLR) for earlier date — expensive ($10K+)
- Letter saved at: `~/AI/finance/taxes-2024/docs/S-Corp IRS Response.pdf`

### 2024 Tax Liability (Schedule C — Sole Prop)
- Gross: $113,023 | Expenses: $24,405 | COGS est: $2,400 | Net: ~$86,219
- Federal income tax: ~$5,943
- Self-employment tax: ~$12,182
- California state tax: ~$3,589
- **TOTAL ESTIMATED: ~$21,715**
- **NO estimated payments made for 2024**
- **Return NOT filed — ~10 months overdue**
- Late filing penalties potentially $5,000-7,000+

### 2025 S-Corp Obligations
- Form 1120-S due March 15, 2026 (5 weeks away!)
- Brian paying himself W-2 via Gusto — good, consistent with S-Corp
- Need to verify W-2 salary amount is "reasonable compensation"

### CPA Search
- Brian decided to hire a CPA for both 2024 and 2025 filings
- Top picks researched:
  1. **Dimov Tax** — (866) 681-2140, open 7 days, 586 reviews, handles S-Corp + late filing
  2. **Mary Geong CPA** — (510) 654-4417, mmgeong@aol.com, Piedmont/Oakland, 61 reviews
  3. **Chang & Associates** — (510) 548-1962, 2855 Telegraph Berkeley
- Draft outreach email prepared but Gmail OAuth expired — Brian needs to send manually
- COGS still needs anode inventory count (explained to Brian what this means)

## MAJOR: Revenue Double-Count Discovery

Original tax docs reported $113,023 gross for 2024 — THIS WAS WRONG.
- Zoho is the invoicing system; Stripe is a payment processor Zoho uses
- 516 of 637 Zoho payments were processed through Stripe
- Original report added Stripe ($45,357) + Zoho ($65,844) = $111K
- But the Stripe total is ALREADY INSIDE the Zoho total
- **True 2024 gross revenue: $67,666** (not $113K)
- **Tax owed drops from ~$21,715 to ~$9,200**
- **With penalties: ~$12,343 instead of ~$29,134**

Corrected docs:
- `~/AI/finance/taxes-2024/docs/income/2024-CORRECTED-INCOME-RECONCILIATION.md`
- `~/AI/finance/taxes-2024/docs/expenses/2024-CORRECTED-EXPENSE-SUMMARY.md`
- Zoho full export saved: `~/AI/finance/taxes-2024/docs/income/zoho-export-2025-12-31/`
- Stripe balance summary: `~/AI/finance/taxes-2024/docs/income/stripe-balance-summary-2024.csv`

Revenue sources (Zoho = source of truth):
- Stripe via Zoho: $46,977 (516 payments)
- Zoho Payments: $10,332 (87 payments)
- PayPal: $4,463 (28 payments)
- Cash/Check/Venmo/Bank: $4,072 (6 payments)
- Wix (non-Zoho): $1,346
- Navier (non-Zoho): $1,200

## Sarah Decision Updated to W-2

After research into CA AB5, workers' comp for diving, and cost comparison:
- **W-2 employee, not 1099 contractor** — AB5 Prong B fails (hull cleaning IS the business)
- **50% per-boat revenue share** — not hourly (incentivizes efficiency), not flat rate (scales with boat)
- **No referral bonus** — more clients = more boats = more money for Sarah already built in
- W-2 employer costs ~$720/month extra — buys AB5 compliance, workers' comp, full quality control
- Sarah keeps ~$500/month more as W-2 (7.65% FICA vs 15.3% SE tax)
- All docs updated in Obsidian: `SailorSkills/Business/Employee Expansion/`

## YNAB Categories Discussed
Brian asked about business expense categories. Recommended additions:
- Vehicle/Fuel, Professional Services, Stripe Fees, Phone & Internet, Equipment & Technology, Training
- Merge Software Services + Annual Software Subs into one category
- Rename "General" to something specific (or kill it)
