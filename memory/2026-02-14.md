# 2026-02-14 (Friday — Valentine's Day)

## Morning Context
- Brian applying to Frontier Tower in SF (referred by James Kirsch)
- Going to a cuddle party tonight (Valentine's Day) + another Frontier Tower event

## Key Insight: Close Quarters Maneuvering as Relationship Metaphor
Brian realized a powerful analogy from his sailing teaching: everyone thinks crossing an ocean is the hardest part, but it's actually the close quarters maneuvering — moving a boat in tight spaces, near hard things — that brings the most anxiety. Once you're in open water, it's easier.

He sees this as a metaphor for relationships: the small moments, the closeness, the intimacy — how to foster it, how to navigate it safely — those are the unexpected building blocks that lead to the ocean crossings together. The daily tight-quarters work is harder than the big dramatic stuff.

And this is literally what he teaches people professionally — to be calm and confident in tight spaces. To move with elegance when everything is close and hard.

## Brian as Teacher
- Teaching sailing has brought him the most joy over the past ~20 years
- People hire him to teach them to sail oceans aboard their own boats
- His specialty: helping people overcome fear and unlock confidence in close quarters maneuvering (docking, tight spaces, high winds, strong currents)
- He accesses a calm, focused state under pressure that brings him deep satisfaction
- Greatest joy: leading others to unlock their potential in those spaces
- Also: six-day bikepacking trip across southern Utah (2024 highlight)
- "I like how I feel when I use my body"
- Passionate about teaching, holding space, guiding, serving others

## Appreciating Serenity Site
- Built and deployed: appreciatingserenity.com + appreciateserenity.com
- Dark mode only, 8 sections, research-backed content on dopamine/digital addiction
- Jimmy Carr quote attributed, Amazon affiliate tag (sail01-20)
- Icons and waveform dividers added
- Added to briancline.co portfolio

## Meet Brian Page
- Built and deployed: meet.briancline.co
- Personal introduction page for intentional partner search (not dating apps)
- Meeting people through friends, TMC, events, workshops
- Copy includes: underwater work, solo Hawaii race ("second hardest thing"), bikepacking, freight trains, NVC, "I want to be in awe of my partner"
- Photos still placeholder — needs real images

## Mission Control Fix
- Fixed gateway WebSocket: changed client ID from 'mission-control' to 'openclaw-control-ui'
- ● LIVE mode now working

## OpenClaw Update
- Updated fnm openclaw from 2026.2.12 to 2026.2.13
- Gateway restart attempted to fix memory_search module error
- Need to verify memory_search works after restart

## Frontier Tower Application
- "What I'm working on": Building a marine services platform and diving business in the East Bay, and exploring how technology can support personal growth and community
- Brag: pending (solo sailed to Hawaii, teaches sailing, built AI copilot)
- Contribute: teaching, hosting conversations about intentional tech use, personal development workshops

## Dating Profile Draft
- Brian agreed to create an authentic dating profile (not polished marketing copy)
- Memory search tool was broken (module error) so couldn't pull personality data automatically
- Still in progress — need to ask Brian directly about what he's looking for, values, deal-breakers

## Intentional Partner Search Values (from conversation)
- Off dating apps permanently — sees them as same dopamine treadmill as social media
- Meeting people through friends, TMC, events, workshops (attachment workshop, improv, cuddle party, Frontier Tower)
- Wants: someone passionate about something, someone he can be in awe of, active, curious about themselves
- Real connection over convenience

## Appreciating Serenity Wins Board
- UI built (form + placeholder wins display)
- Needs Supabase or similar backend for actual submissions — not yet connected

## Pre-Compaction State
- memory_search tool still broken (dist/manager-DtFcs1NT.js module not found) — version mismatch between CLI versions
- OpenClaw versions: Homebrew CLI 2026.1.29, fnm CLI 2026.2.13, gateway 2026.2.3-1

## Memory Search Fixed (later in day)
- Root cause: local embeddinggemma-300M model had ~256 token context window — too small for memory files. Only 10/37 files indexed.
- Switched to OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` — all 37 files / 208 chunks now indexed
- Brian funded OpenAI account with $10 (embeddings cost ~$0.03 for full index)
- Sessions source disabled from memory search — 2000+ session JSONL files caused OOM/timeouts

## Security Hardening
- LaunchAgent plist (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist`) — removed old OAuth token, Brave key, gateway token. Permissions locked to 600.
- Telegram fully locked down: DMs allowlist-only (`tg:7682357515`), groups allowlist-only (only War Room `-5239741576`)
- `dmPolicy: "allowlist"` and `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` on all three bots

## War Room Telegram Group
- Group ID: `-5239741576`, members: Brian, Ajit, Jorge (Ajit's bot), Howard
- **Howard not receiving group messages** — no inbound Telegram traffic in gateway logs at all
- Gateway warning: "limits bots to 100 commands. 105 configured; registering first 100"
- Most likely cause: BotFather privacy mode preventing bot from seeing group messages
- Brian needs to: `/mybots` → @Howard_1_Bot → Bot Settings → Group Privacy → Turn Off

## Meet Brian — Sailing/Teaching Paragraph Added
- Added close quarters maneuvering paragraph after solo Hawaii race section
- Pushed to `standardhuman/meet-brian`, auto-deploying to `meet.briancline.co`

## Replaced Robot Emoji in Mission Control
- Changed 🤖 wall poster → ⛵ sailboat in OfficeBackground.tsx
