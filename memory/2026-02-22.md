## Partnership Pillar

### Pillar 7 Added
Brian wants to add Partnership as a 7th pillar — finding and building a deep intimate relationship. Not urgent, but intentional. This is important enough to track alongside the other pillars, not just nest under Wellbeing.

### Relationship Context (captured from conversation)
- **Lauren:** lived on boat at marina; breakup was destabilizing — Brian avoided marina during certain hours for months to dodge her. Gutting experience.
- **Allison:** 10-month relationship, ended Dec 5 2025, processed well through TMC. Built "Completing Relationships" web app to process it (`~/AI/personal/relationships/`).
- **Sarah:** lives on Brian's dock, now in a relationship with someone else. Decided not to pursue — marina is too important (work + community) to risk another Lauren-type situation, and Sarah is even closer to Brian's boat.
- **Dating apps:** Done. 20 years since 2006 (Plenty of Fish, OkCupid, etc.). Pattern of short-term relationships. Apps create anxiety, addictive behavior, devalue the person in front of him. Not going back.

### Strategy
- Show up at aligned events: attachment workshops, circling, authentic relating, improv, play workshops
- Leverage TMC network: send email asking the men to think about women in their lives
- Keep doing the coursework (Communication Dojo)
- No rush — independence feels good right now

### Communication Dojo
- 5-week course (Feb 1 - Mar 1, 2026), Sundays 10am-12pm PT
- Facilitators: Newt Bailey & Leeza
- Today is Week 4 (Feb 22)
- Obsidian vault has full structure: README, weekly notes, quizzes, NVC reference, practice logs
- Weekly notes are mostly empty templates — Brian hasn't filled them in yet
- Howard study support built in (quiz, practice partner, debrief) — never used

### Obsidian Vault Fix
- Vault was in `~/Documents/Brian's Vault/` — iCloud was evicting files (SF_DATALESS flag)
- Moved to `~/Obsidian/Brian's Vault/` — outside iCloud's reach
- Obsidian Sync is the sync method (not iCloud)
- TOOLS.md updated with new path

### Memory Gap Identified
- The session that built the Communication Dojo vault structure never wrote a memory entry
- Brian flagged this — I had no recollection of building it
- Added dual-write rule to AGENTS.md: always capture in BOTH memory files AND Obsidian vault

## Obsidian Vault Restructured

Added Life layer alongside SailorSkills:
- `Home.md` — vault overview/navigation page linking all key docs
- `Life/Partnership/README.md` — Pillar 7 with full context, strategy, history, check-in prompts
- `Life/Howard's Memory.md` — readable version of what Howard carries (team, decisions, worries, rhythm, locations)
- `SailorSkills/Strategy/7 Powers Analysis.md` — condensed from ~/clawd/reports/
- `SailorSkills/Strategy/Powers × Pillars Integration.md` — how pillars build Powers

Vault path: ~/Obsidian/Brian's Vault/ (moved from ~/Documents/ due to iCloud eviction)

## Memory Safety Net

Added 4 daily checkpoints + mandatory memory footer on all work crons:
- 🕛 Midnight Memory Sync (silent) — catches day-end gaps
- 🌅 6am Dawn Patrol — pre-flight memory audit for yesterday  
- 🔍 12pm Midday Memory Sync (silent) — catches morning gaps
- 🌅 6:30pm Evening Debrief — vault scan + Partnership check-in
- All work crons (Noa, Voice Memos) now have "BEFORE FINISHING: update memory" footer

Also added dual-write rule to AGENTS.md: capture in BOTH memory files AND Obsidian vault.

## Trust Network & Review System Spec

Full spec written: `~/AI/business/sailorskills/marketplace/docs/specs/trust-network-reviews.md`
Also synced to Obsidian: `SailorSkills/Architecture/trust-network-reviews.md`

Key design decisions:
- No star ratings — recommendation-based (yes / yes with caveats / no)
- No anonymous reviews — real identity required
- Boat owner verification via peer vouching (web of trust from Brian as root)
- Two-way reviews: owners review providers (public), providers review owners (provider-only)
- Provider-to-provider vouching and referral network
- Trust graph architecture: Brian seeds it, peer verification scales it
- 4 phases: basic reviews (March 5) → owner verification → two-way + provider network → full network effects

Also added Peter Yang YouTube to Noa's nightly research sources.

## Trust Network Review System — Phase 1 Built

**Commit:** a143fd7 (marketplace repo)
**Migration:** 20260222010000_trust_network_phase1.sql — applied to production Supabase

### What was deployed:
- **All 4 phases of database schema** — provider_reviews, owner_reviews, boat_owner_verifications, owner_vouches, verification_requests, provider_vouches, provider_referrals, review_flags
- **Full RLS policies** for all tables
- **Triggers** for auto-verification tier updates and provider review aggregate stats
- **Phase 1 UI components:**
  - ReviewForm (service type, date, relationship depth, recommendation buttons — no stars)
  - ReviewCard (reviewer info + verification badge + provider response)
  - ReviewSummary (recommendation bar: yes/caveats/no percentages)
  - ReviewList (filter by type or verified, older reviews collapsed)
  - VerificationBadge (gold/verified/pending/unverified)
- **ProviderDetail page updated** — reviews section added, star ratings replaced with recommendation display
- Types are untyped (cast to any) because Supabase generated types don't include new tables — need to regenerate

### What's next for Phase 2 UI:
- Boat registration flow (add boat to profile with marina)
- Brian admin: manual gold verification
- Peer vouching request/response flow
- VouchRequest notification component
