## Partnership Pillar

### Pillar 7 Added
Brian wants to add Partnership as a 7th pillar — finding and building a deep intimate relationship. Not urgent, but intentional. This is important enough to track alongside the other pillars, not just nest under Wellbeing.

### Relationship Context (captured from conversation)
- **Lauren:** lived on boat at marina; breakup was destabilizing — Brian avoided marina during certain hours for months to dodge her. Gutting experience.
- **Allison:** 10-month relationship, ended Dec 5 2025, processed well through TMC. Built "Completing Relationships" web app to process it (`~/AI/personal/relationships/`).
- **Sarah:** lives on Brian's dock, now in a relationship with someone else. Decided not to pursue — marina is too important (work + community) to risk another Lauren-type situation, and Sarah is even closer to Brian's boat.
- **Dating apps:** Done. 20 years since 2006 (Plenty of Fish, OkCupid, etc.). Pattern of short-term relationships. Apps create anxiety, addictive behavior, devalue the person in front of him. Not going back.

### Strategy
- Show up at aligned events: attachment workshops, circling, authentic relating, improv, play workshops
- Leverage TMC network: send email asking the men to think about women in their lives
- Keep doing the coursework (Communication Dojo)
- No rush — independence feels good right now

### Communication Dojo
- 5-week course (Feb 1 - Mar 1, 2026), Sundays 10am-12pm PT
- Facilitators: Newt Bailey & Leeza
- Today is Week 4 (Feb 22)
- Obsidian vault has full structure: README, weekly notes, quizzes, NVC reference, practice logs
- Weekly notes are mostly empty templates — Brian hasn't filled them in yet
- Howard study support built in (quiz, practice partner, debrief) — never used

### Obsidian Vault Fix
- Vault was in `~/Documents/Brian's Vault/` — iCloud was evicting files (SF_DATALESS flag)
- Moved to `~/Obsidian/Brian's Vault/` — outside iCloud's reach
- Obsidian Sync is the sync method (not iCloud)
- TOOLS.md updated with new path

### Memory Gap Identified
- The session that built the Communication Dojo vault structure never wrote a memory entry
- Brian flagged this — I had no recollection of building it
- Added dual-write rule to AGENTS.md: always capture in BOTH memory files AND Obsidian vault
