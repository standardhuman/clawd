## Noa — Daily Research Brief
- **Report:** `reports/2026-02-24-research.md`
- **Key findings:**
  1. Greg Isenberg new episode (Feb 23): "How I Use Obsidian + Claude Code to Run My Life" with Internet Vin — custom slash commands for Obsidian as AI thinking partner. Directly validates Brian's OpenClaw + Obsidian setup.
  2. Ladybird browser adopted Rust with AI-assisted port — 25K lines C++ → Rust in 2 weeks, zero regressions, 1,147 pts on HN. Best case study yet for AI-directed code migration.
  3. "Car Wash Test" — simple reasoning benchmark that 42/53 AI models fail. Opus 4.6 is one of only 5 that pass 10/10 consistently.
  4. Simon Willison's new "Code is Cheap" agentic engineering pattern
  5. FreeBSD Wi-Fi driver built by AI (343 pts HN) — further validates plan-first methodology
- **Sources updated:** SOURCES.md v6 — added Internet Vin, Opper.ai
- **0 web_search calls used** (all web_fetch)
