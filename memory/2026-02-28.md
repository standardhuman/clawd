## Noa Research Brief
- **Report:** `reports/2026-02-28-research.md`
- **Key findings:** OpenAI/Anthropic DoW split (OpenAI deploys in classified networks, Anthropic draws lines, "cancel ChatGPT" trends on HN); Unfucked (UNF*) filesystem flight recorder for agent safety; Free Claude Max for 10K OSS maintainers; Max Woolf's agent coding skeptic-to-convert post with shareable AGENTS.md template; OpenAI $110B raise at $730B valuation with bearish HN sentiment; Claude-File-Recovery tool for mining session transcripts
- **0 web_search calls used** (all web_fetch)

## SailorSkills Pro Launch Prep (Morning)
- **Blake** reviewed Save & Invoice (Build 51) — found $0 invoice bug (cost=0 still fires invoice)
- **Jacques** fixed ISSUE-3 ($0 invoice guard), committed `c9982cf`, pushed Build 52 to TestFlight (delivery UUID: `652ce6bb`)
- **Jacques sub-agent** (DeepSeek): Built pricing integration with `provider_services` table — new `useProviderPricing` hook, updated `calculateServiceCost`, commit `a223501`
- **Reese** coordinated agent updates, relayed Jacques's results
- **Howard** relayed 3 launch-blocking items to Brian:
  1. Add Blake to TestFlight testers
  2. Run `supabase secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...`
  3. Field test Build 52 with real GoPro (BLE → WiFi → video transfer)
- March 1 (tomorrow) is target launch day for Pro tier
