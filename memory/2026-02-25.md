# 2026-02-25 — Org Standup Day

## Cross-Agent Communication Enabled
- `subagents.allowAgents: ["*"]` added to all 13 agents in gateway config
- `tools.sessions.visibility: "all"` enabled — agents can see each other's sessions
- Team directory + comms instructions added to all 12 agent AGENTS.md files
- `sessions_send(sessionKey="agent:AGENTID:main")` for messages, `sessions_spawn(agentId)` for tasks

## Jacques Pro Staffing Proposal — Approved
- Jacques sent inter-agent proposal requesting shared services for Pro development
- Doc: `~/AI/business/sailorskills/pro/docs/proposal-dev-team-workflow.md`
- Approved all four allocations:
  - **Reese (PM)** ~5-10 hrs/week — specs, roadmap, feature tracker
  - **Blake (QA)** ~5-8 hrs/week — TestFlight testing, regression checklist
  - **Cyrus (Security)** ~3-5 hrs/review — security audit, pre-release gate
  - **Milo (Marketing)** ~3-5 hrs/week — positioning, go-to-market prep

## Reese Assigned to Both Products
- PM for Pro AND Marketplace — single coordinator across both
- Marketplace briefing included: trust graph, placeholder claim flow, March 5 crew party target
- Reese is Brian's single point of contact for priorities on both products

## Workflow Established
- Brian (vision) → Reese (spec) → Jacques/Marcel (build) → Blake (QA) → Brian (field test) → Cyrus (security gate) → Milo (marketing)
- Inter-agent comms stay internal (not visible on Telegram) — option 1 chosen
- Reese coordinates day-to-day; Howard handles resource allocation and org-level issues

## Skills Added to All Agents
- Every agent's AGENTS.md now has role-appropriate skills with paths to SKILL.md files
- Reese: product-management, project-planning, scheduling, github, decision-making
- Blake: github, coding-agent, healthcheck
- Cyrus: healthcheck, github, 1password
- Milo: marketing, summarize, sag, nano-banana-pro
- Noa: summarize, blogwatcher, web tools, github
- Kai: brainstorming, decision-making, design-exploration, pricing-strategy, business-planning
- Jacques/Marcel: coding-agent, github, summarize
- Quinn: gog, scheduling, apple-reminders, github
- Sage: finance, budgeting, tax-mitigation
- Avery: gog, himalaya, scheduling, apple-reminders
- Rio: self-connection, nvc-conversation, sleep/strength/nutrition, daily routines, weekly-review

## Org Restructure — Morning
- Git commits: org restructure proposal + refocus Noa/Kai, org docs alignment
- 20+ Obsidian vault files updated in `Organization/` — team profiles, operations manual, strategy docs
- Obsidian `SailorSkills/` also updated: Rio profile, Powers × Pillars integration, Pillars

## Sage — Tax Review
- Full tax situation briefing delivered to Brian
- 2024 federal return ~11 months overdue, estimated ~$12K with penalties
- 2025 S-Corp return (1120-S) due March 15 — 18 days out
- CPA call still needed — three candidates identified but not contacted
- CA EDD number should have arrived by now (Feb 24 expected)

## Morning Development Sprint (Post-Org Setup)

### Blake — Code Review Complete
- Pro Build 49: **15 bugs found** — 4 blockers, 5 medium, 6 low
- Blockers: bleReady bypass, Enable WiFi not gated, broken download resume (corrupts files), stale mock service
- Marketplace mobile nav: ✅ Ship it — Marcel's fix is correct
- Waiting on Reese to route bug list to Jacques

### Cyrus — Deep Security Audit
- Service role key worse than initial triage:
  - `.env`, `.env.production`, `.env.staging` ALL committed to git with service role key
  - `supabaseAdmin` client bypasses all RLS; 13+ hooks use `getClient()` preferring admin
  - `.env.production` has `AUTO_DEV_LOGIN=true` with hardcoded dev user ID
- **P0**: Service role key — fix before TestFlight goes beyond Brian
- **P1**: Placeholder profiles RLS bug (OR vs AND logic), Stripe secret key in marketplace .env
- **P2**: Trust edge manipulation (no rate limiting), auto dev login in production
- Recommends not waiting until March 4 — Jacques should architect fix now

### Jacques — Bug Fixes Shipped
- 3 fixes committed (80997b8): Browse Media disabled in State 5, scan timeout verified, cancel button during connect
- Dropped "Initializing…" status text per Reese's spec
- Service role key assessment: not March 1 blocker if TestFlight-only, hard blocker before App Store
- Fix estimate: 4-8 hours (move to edge functions)
- Ready for build 50

### Reese — March 1 Status Coordination
- Sequenced Jacques on spec gaps; confirmed what's in/fixing/deferred for March 1
- Key open question to Brian: **Is March 1 TestFlight or App Store submission?** (changes risk tolerance)
- Deferred: BLE auto-reconnect, offline logging, photo attachments, calendar integration, YouTube upload, client signatures
- Workflow updated: Blake does code QA (not device testing) → Brian does device testing

### Milo — Marketing Positioning
- Reviewed feature tracker + Marketplace site
- Pro positioning: "No purpose-built app for hull cleaning divers" + GoPro = killer differentiator
- Marketplace: "Who do you trust with your boat?" — recommendation-driven, not algorithm-driven
- Wants to turn Brian's field testing into content (building in public narrative)
- March 5 crew party: needs audience info, existing footage, provider profile status

### Marcel — Marketplace Development
- Working on traversal functions
- Acknowledged Reese's placeholder claim spec, will review after traversal work
- Dashboard data collection ran: $552/mo actual vs $1,092/mo API-equivalent

## Subagent Results
- **Blake**: Created QA regression checklist (10 categories) at `~/AI/business/sailorskills/pro/docs/qa-regression-checklist.md`
- **Reese (Pro)**: Wrote GoPro Connection Flow Spec + Feature Tracker
- **Reese (Marketplace)**: Created ONBOARDING.md, ROADMAP.md, FEATURE_TRACKER.md, INITIAL_ANALYSIS.md, placeholder-claim-flow.md
- **Cyrus**: Initial security audit — CRITICAL: service role key in app bundle, RLS bypass via dev mode, auth bypass via auto-login. Written to `~/AI/business/sailorskills/pro/docs/security-audit-initial.md`
- **Milo**: Marketing positioning draft at `~/AI/business/sailorskills/pro/docs/marketing-positioning-draft.md`

## Afternoon — Reese/Jacques Invoice Flow
- Reese wrote Save & Invoice spec for Pro Approve screen
- Tier 1 (Save & Invoice): Wire `sendInvoice` into ApproveScreen after `createServiceLog` — 2-3 hrs, Jacques starting today
- Tier 2 (Save & Charge with card on file): Deferred — no `stripe_customer_id` column, empty `payment_methods` table
- Decision tree: card on file → green "Save & Charge", no card → blue "Save & Invoice", no email → "Save" only
- Jacques confirmed `payment_methods` table empty, no `stripe_customer_id` on `boat_owners` or `boats`

## Late Evening — Build 51 Shipped
- Jacques landed Save & Invoice on Approve screen, committed (821d8ba), built and uploaded Build 51 to TestFlight
- Build 51 includes: all Build 50 GoPro fixes + Save & Invoice button + Save Only fallback + no-email handling
- Invoice failure doesn't block save (graceful degradation)
- Reese confirmed this is the launch build — full pipeline: speak → extract → review → invoice → paid, under 60 seconds
- **Still needed before field test**: Brian must set Stripe test key via `npx supabase secrets set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_XXXXX --project-ref dxyzxcmhhhepjndxunwx`
- Blake noted he can't do device testing (server-side only) — his Build 50 code review stands; needs new commits diff for Build 51 review
- Blake still needs TestFlight tester access in App Store Connect

## Evening Debrief
- No boats today; tomorrow Sarah 9:30 AM BRK Dock O Slip 614
- No voice memos
- 20+ Obsidian vault files updated (org restructure)
- Tax: CPA call still not made — March 15 deadline 18 days out
- Build 50 clean per Blake — ready for Feb 28 field test
- TMC circle tonight (Wednesday)
