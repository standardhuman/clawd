## January Billing Completed

Finished January 2026 billing run:
- 53 boats serviced
- ~$9,700 total billed
- Fixed critical bug: payment_method wasn't being passed to Stripe /pay call
- Charged 31 invoices that were stuck "open"

## Tom Purcell Price Complaint

- Complained about increase from $99 to $135.82
- Cause: Growth surcharge (Mod→Heavy = 37.5%) that Brian hadn't been enforcing
- Resolution: Voided $135.82, sent new $99 invoice as one-time courtesy
- Brian sent email explaining the policy going forward

## Billing Dashboard Code Fix

The key fix in `billing-dashboard/server/index.ts`:
```typescript
// Before: just called /pay with no payment method
await fetch(`/invoices/${invoiceId}/pay`, ...)

// After: explicitly pass the payment method
await fetch(`/invoices/${invoiceId}/pay`, {
  body: `payment_method=${paymentMethodId}`
})
```

Many Stripe customers have cards attached but no `default_payment_method` set on the customer object. Without explicitly passing the payment method ID, Stripe doesn't know which card to charge.

## Remaining Open Invoices

Customers without cards (correct behavior — they'll pay via invoice link):
- Lexie Price (Innamorata) $288.64
- Peter Baczek (Diva) $172.87
- Craig Aufenkamp (Salty Lady) $161.64
- Paul Weismann (Mojo) $148.17
- Greta Mart (Pearl) $202.05
- Lu Luna (Msafiri) $121.23

Needs follow-up:
- Casey: Card declined ($90)
