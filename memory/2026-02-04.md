## SailorSkills Onboarding Script

Created automated customer onboarding tooling:

**New files:**
- `~/AI/business/sailorskills/scripts/onboard-customer.ts` - CLI script to onboard new customers
- `~/AI/business/sailorskills/scripts/package.json` - dependencies (stripe, @supabase/supabase-js, dotenv, etc.)
- `~/AI/business/sailorskills/scripts/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript config
- `~/AI/business/sailorskills/scripts/.gitignore` - ignores node_modules, .env
- `~/AI/business/sailorskills/docs/workflows/new-customer-onboarding.md` - workflow documentation

**What the script does:**
1. Creates customer in Stripe
2. Creates customer record in Supabase
3. Creates boat record in Supabase (linked to customer)
4. Creates Stripe subscription with appropriate pricing
5. Outputs confirmation with IDs

**Backup created:**
- `~/AI/business/sailorskills/docs/workflows/wix-redirects-backup.csv` - backed up Wix redirect rules

## Dennis Zinn Lookup

Brian asked to check if Dennis Zinn was in Supabase - searched customers, boats, quotes, service_orders tables but found no match. Order may have come through email/phone/Stripe directly rather than the diving.sailorskills.com form.

## Files Reviewed

- `boaty-desktop/src-tauri/src/config.rs` - Tauri app configuration
- `boaty-desktop/src/lib/stores/settings.ts` - Settings store
- `boaty-desktop/src/lib/stores/upload.ts` - Upload queue store
- `marketplace/src/pages/Order.tsx` - Marketplace order page
- `pro/supabase/functions/process-order/index.ts` - Edge function for processing orders

## Supabase State

- Boats table has records (Lil Bear, Tern, Solo, Coquelicot, etc.) but customer_name/customer_email not filled in
- Only test customers ("Sample Customer") in customers table
- Database ready for real customer data via onboarding script
