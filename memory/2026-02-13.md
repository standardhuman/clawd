## Peter's Ram 1500 — Potential Purchase

Brian considering buying housemate Peter's truck.

### Vehicle Details
- **2016 Ram 1500 Laramie, ~125K miles**
- **Asking price:** $17,000
- 5.7L Hemi V8, 8-speed ZF automatic
- Has regular cruise control (not adaptive)

### Aftermarket Build (Peter's DIY — high quality)
- High-end low-profile fiberglass cap
- Bed platform with nice drawer system
- On-board compressor
- 80/20 aluminum extrusion roof rack
- 2× 100W solar panels
- 200Ah lithium battery
- 2,000W inverter
- Fox suspension (aftermarket)
- Aftermarket front + rear bumpers
- Aftermarket rims + good tires
- Logo delete throughout

### Valuation
- Stock truck at 125K: ~$14,000-18,000 private party
- Aftermarket build value (new): ~$11,600-20,600
- Mods recover ~40-60% at resale = $5,000-12,000 added value
- Fair market for the built truck: $18,000-25,000
- **Peter asking $17K = good deal** (basically stock price, mods free)

### Known Issues to Watch (2016 5.7 Hemi)
1. **Hemi tick (lifters/cam)** — $2,000-4,000 if present. Ticking that stays when warm = bad.
2. **Exhaust manifold bolts** — notorious for breaking. $500-1,000. Ticking on cold start that goes away = this.
3. **Water pump** — common failure 80K-120K. $400-600 if original at 125K.
4. Transmission (8-speed ZF) — generally good, ask about shift quality
5. TIPM electrical gremlins — less common on 2016
6. Hemi engine lifespan: 200K-300K+ miles with regular maintenance. At 125K = roughly halfway.

### Purchase Costs
- Price: $17,000
- CA sales tax (10.25%): ~$1,742
- DMV registration + transfer: ~$300-400
- Smog: seller's responsibility in CA (Peter must provide)
- **All-in: ~$19,100-19,200**

### Trade-in: 2017 Subaru Outback Limited
- 165K miles + light body damage
- Estimated private party value: $6,500-9,000
- **Net out of pocket for swap: ~$10,100-12,600**

### Ongoing Cost Comparison (annual)
- Insurance: $1,800-3,000/yr (up from Outback)
- Gas: ~$3,125/yr at 16 MPG (roughly double the Outback)
- Maintenance: ~$1,200-2,000/yr
- Registration: ~$200-300/yr
- Total: ~$6,300-8,400/yr

### Questions to Ask Peter
- Hemi tick present? (listen cold + warm)
- Exhaust manifold bolts replaced?
- Water pump replaced?
- Transmission fluid history + shift quality?
- Spark plugs done? (16 plugs, due every 100K)
- Service records?
- Clean title, no liens?
- Smog current?

### Open Considerations
- Potential S-Corp business vehicle deduction (work truck for dive gear hauling)
- Fuel cost increase significant (~$200-300/mo more than Outback)

2. 2024 personal return prep (~$12,343 with penalties)
3. 2025 1120-S filing (due March 15, 2026)
