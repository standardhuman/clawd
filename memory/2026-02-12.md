## California Piece-Rate Labor Law Research

Brian asked about CA labor law for piece-rate (per-boat) employees. Key findings:

### CA Labor Code §226.2 (AB 1513) — Three Separate Pay Requirements
1. **Rest & Recovery Periods** — must be paid SEPARATELY from piece rate, at higher of average hourly rate or minimum wage ($16.50/hr). 10-min break per 4 hrs worked.
2. **Nonproductive Time** — time under employer control but not doing piece work (travel between boats, setup, cleanup). Must be paid separately at min wage or higher.
3. **Overtime still applies** — calculated from "regular rate" = total piece earnings ÷ total hours worked that week. 1.5x for >8 hrs/day or >40 hrs/week.

### Practical Implications for SailorSkills
- Must track hours even though paying per boat
- Pay stubs need separate line items: piece-rate pay, rest-period pay, nonproductive time
- Gusto can handle piece-rate payroll with separate line items
- Since divers make well above min wage (~$120/hr effective), minimums aren't the concern — tracking and pay stub compliance is
- Important for ANY future piece-rate W-2 hire, not just Sarah

## Obsidian Vault Status
- Vault at ~/Documents/Brian's Vault/ (iCloud copy trashed)
- Obsidian Sync connected ($20/mo)
- Plugins: Dataview (working), Charts, Excalidraw, Git
- Dataview quirk: `FROM "folder"` broken (apostrophe in vault name?), use `WHERE contains(file.folder, "folder")` instead
- Dashboard.md with Dataview queries auto-lists project files by frontmatter
- YAML frontmatter added to Employee Expansion docs (5 files) + MVP Tracker

## Dashboard Interactive Upgrade (v2)
- All 6 interactive features shipped and deployed:
  1. Expandable project cards (checklist, activity, docs)
  2. Clickable needs-attention items (detail context, CPA phone numbers, etc.)
  3. Sprint issues drill-down (6 open issues listed)
  4. Activity timeline detail (click to expand descriptions)
  5. Interactive to-do section (checkboxes persist to localStorage, 3 categories)
  6. Time allocation donut chart drill-down
- Design: smooth 300ms transitions, chevrons, #2a2a3e expanded backgrounds
- data.json now has nested detail fields for all sections
- Brian's bullet journal items integrated into to-do section

## Piece-Rate Compliance Doc Added to Obsidian
- New file: `SailorSkills/Business/Employee Expansion/Piece-Rate Compliance.md`
- Covers CA Labor Code §226.2, time tracking plan, pay stub requirements
- "Start Day / End Day" feature added to Jacques' Pro app backlog (Phase 1.5: Employee Readiness)

## Insurance Broker Response (Feb 12)
- **Henry Medina at Novamar Insurance Group** responded (Katrina moved from Mariners General to Novamar)
- **USL&H IS REQUIRED** for in-water dive service — standard CA state WC NOT sufficient
- Key factor: it's the in-water/commercial diving nature, not whether it's "ship repair"
- Estimated WC+USL&H cost: ~$3,500–$4,800/yr for $36K–$48K payroll
- To add W-2 employee to GL policy, broker needs: name+DOB, new gross receipts, estimated payroll
- RLI GL does NOT cover employee liability (confirmed)
- 1099 alternative noted but not viable under AB5
- Contact: Henry Medina (619) 226-8661, Henry@novamar.net; Katrina@novamar.net
- All docs updated: MEMORY.md, W-2 vs 1099 Comparison (Obsidian), web dashboard

## Anthropic Cowork Plugins Ported
- Ported all 6 Anthropic knowledge-work plugins to OpenClaw skills: product-management, finance, legal, customer-support, sales, marketing
- 2,140 total lines of domain expertise, all at ~/clawd/skills/
- These caused $285B stock market selloff on Feb 3-4 when released as "Claude Cowork" plugins

## Key Context for Next Session
- Sarah hiring ON HOLD in all docs (MEMORY.md, Obsidian, web dashboard)
- Insurance question now RESOLVED: USL&H required, ~$3,500-4,800/yr
- needsarenormal.com transfer completes ~Feb 16 — add Resend DNS after
- Both dashboards (Obsidian + web) maintained in sync during conversations
- Piece-rate labor law research should be added to Sarah hiring docs in Obsidian for future reference
