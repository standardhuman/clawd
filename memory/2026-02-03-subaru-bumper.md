A new session was started via /new or /reset. Say hi briefly (1-2 sentences) and ask what the user wants to do next. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model in the greeting. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

assistant: Hey Brian. What are we working on?
user: [Telegram Brian id:7682357515 +41s 2026-02-02 17:49 PST] Can you help me find a rear bumper for a Subaru outback 2017, ideally in the burgundy red color. It’s not the part with the sensors, but below that
[message_id: 1044]
assistant: Let me clarify — on the 2017 Outback, the main rear bumper cover (part 57704AL11B) is actually one piece that includes both the upper painted area and the lower textured section. 

Can you describe more specifically what's damaged? Is it:
1. **The lower black textured section** that wraps under the bumper
2. **A separate trim piece** around the exhaust/muffler area
3. **The full bumper cover** (the whole painted panel)

Also, Subaru's burgundy for that year is **Venetian Red Pearl (H2U)** — does that sound right?

In the meantime, I found one promising eBay listing that's specifically a 2015-2017 Outback rear bumper in burgundy from a 2016 donor car:
- **eBay LOT3440** — ~$200-300 range for the full OEM bumper cover in burgundy
- Link: https://www.ebay.com/itm/405164129120

If you just need the lower section, getting the exact part name will help narrow it down.

[Telegram Brian id:7682357515 +4m 2026-02-02 17:54 PST] Oh yea, it’s the upper painted part that wraps around from wheel well to wheel well.
[message_id: 1046]
assistant: Good — that's the main rear bumper cover. Here are your options:

**Option 1: Pre-Painted New (ReveMoto)**
- **$1,050** — aftermarket bumper painted to match
- 20 business day lead time
- Lifetime paint warranty
- They have Venetian Red Pearl (your color is likely **H2Q**)
- Link: https://www.revemoto.com/products/2017-subaru-outback-rear-bumper-painted

**Option 2: Used OEM Burgundy (eBay)**
- **~$200-400** — already in your color, no painting needed
- That burgundy one I found: https://www.ebay.com/itm/405164129120 (from a 2016 donor, fits 2015-2017)
- Condition varies — check photos carefully

**Option 3: New OEM Unpainted + Paint Shop**
- **~$186-210** for the bumper (part 57704AL11B without sensors, or 57702AL13A with sensors)
- Plus **$300-500** for a body shop to paint it
- Total: ~$500-700

**Quick question:** Does your bumper have the parking sensor holes? That determines which part number you need.

Also, double-check your color code — it's on the sticker inside the driver's door jamb. Should be H2Q (Venetian Red Pearl) for the burgundy 2017 Outback.
user: [Telegram Brian id:7682357515 +52s 2026-02-02 17:55 PST] It does have the parking sensor holes.
[message_id: 1048]
assistant: Found exactly what you need:

**eBay - Burgundy OEM with Sensor Holes**
- **$249** (or best offer)
- 2015-2017 Outback rear bumper, burgundy, painted
- Has parking sensor holes
- Good used condition
- Seller has 6,155 feedback, 4.9 rating
- 14-day returns accepted
- Link: https://www.ebay.com/itm/401477628453

That's your best bet for a drop-in replacement without needing paint work. I'd message the seller to confirm the color code matches yours (H2Q Venetian Red Pearl) before buying — burgundy shades can vary.

Want me to keep looking for other options, or does this one look good?

**For the bumper:** eBay listing at $249 with sensor holes in burgundy looks solid. Confirm color code H2Q with seller before buying.
