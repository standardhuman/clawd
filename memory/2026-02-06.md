# 2026-02-06 — Daily Notes

## Headshot Editing (Feb 5)
- Used nano-banana-pro to edit Brian's headshot from briancline.io website
- Source: `~/AI/business/briancline-co/website/public/images/headshot.png`
- Edits: clean shaven head (bald), softened eye wrinkles, slightly reduced white beard patches around chin
- Final version: `~/AI/business/briancline-co/website/generated_imgs/2025-02-05-headshot-v3.png`
- Took 3 iterations to get the beard right — first version way too dark, needed subtle touch

## Claude Opus 4.6 Upgrade (Feb 5)
- Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.6 on Feb 5, 2026
- API model ID: `claude-opus-4-6`
- 1M token context, $5/$25 per MTok, "agent teams" feature, "adaptive thinking"
- Added to OpenClaw config as custom provider `anthropic` with model entry
- Set as default model for all agents via `agents.defaults.model.primary`
- Config updated and gateway restarted successfully

## TOS / Authentication Deep Dive (Feb 6)
- Brian asked about TOS compliance for using Claude via OpenClaw
- **Key finding:** His API key (`sk-ant-oat01-...`) is an OAuth Access Token (the `oat` prefix), tied to his Max subscription — NOT a separate pay-per-token API key
- Auth profile stored at `~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/auth-profiles.json` as `anthropic:manual` bearer token, expires 2027-01-25
- **Anthropic TOS Section 3, Item 7:** "Except when you are accessing our Services via an Anthropic API Key or where we otherwise explicitly permit it, to access the Services through automated or non-human means, whether through a bot, script, or otherwise."
- Anthropic has been actively cracking down since Jan 2026 — banning users of OpenCode, Roo Code, Kilo Code etc. who route through Max subscriptions
- **Brian's usage is technically in the gray area** — OpenClaw routing Telegram messages through OAuth token
- Heartbeats are NOT active (HEARTBEAT.md is empty/comments only)
- Brian uses it for on-the-go planning/coding sessions, not heavy automated batch work

## Claude Code Telegram Bridge (Feb 6)
- Built a TOS-compliant alternative: Telegram bot that remote-controls Claude Code via tmux
- Location: `~/code/claude-telegram-bridge/`
- Architecture: Telegram → Bot → tmux send-keys → Claude Code CLI → tmux capture-pane → Bot → Telegram
- **Why it's defensible:** Claude Code is the actual client running natively; bot is just a remote keyboard like SSH
- Features:
  - Session management: `/new`, `/resume <id>`, `/sessions`
  - Project shortcuts: `/new ai`, `/new pro`, `/new personal assistant`, `/new pa`, etc.
  - Controls: `/stop` (Ctrl+C), `/screen`, `/yes`, `/no`, `/compact`, `/shell <cmd>`
  - `/projects` command shows all shortcuts
- Project shortcuts mapped:
  - `ai` → ~/AI
  - `pro` / `sailorskills pro` → ~/AI/business/sailorskills/pro
  - `personal assistant` / `pa` → ~/AI/tools/personal-assistant
  - `platform`, `marketing`, `business`, `site`, `briancline`, `clawd` all mapped
- **Still needs:** Telegram bot token from @BotFather to complete setup
- Dependencies installed: grammy, dotenv
- Includes launchd plist for running as background service

## Key Insight
Brian is concerned about Anthropic banning his account. The Claude Code Bridge approach lets him keep his Max plan ($100-200/mo flat) while staying clearly within TOS — Claude Code is explicitly permitted, and adding a remote control layer (like SSH) is just convenience, not automation.
