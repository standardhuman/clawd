Welcome to your morning flow. Find your mat. Close your eyes. Let's begin.

[SILENCE:3s]

Start in child's pose. Knees wide, big toes touching, forehead resting on the mat.

[SILENCE:2s]

Three deep breaths here. Breathe in through your nose, expanding your lower back. And slowly breathe out.

[SILENCE:18s]

Now, slowly come to all fours. Wrists under shoulders, knees under hips. We're moving into cat-cow.

[SILENCE:2s]

Inhale — drop your belly, lift your chest, gaze forward. Exhale — round your spine, tuck your chin, press the floor away.

[SILENCE:2s]

Six more rounds. Follow your breath. Inhale to open, exhale to round.

[SILENCE:48s]

Good. From here, lift your hips up and back into downward dog.

[SILENCE:3s]

Pedal out your feet. Press one heel down, then the other. Wake up your calves and ankles.

[SILENCE:20s]

Now press both heels toward the floor and hold.

[SILENCE:8s]

Step your right foot forward between your hands into a low lunge. Drop your back knee down.

[SILENCE:3s]

Circle your hips gently. A few circles each direction.

[SILENCE:12s]

Now reach back with your right hand and grab your left foot for a quad stretch. Breathe into it.

[SILENCE:10s]

Release the foot. Rise up into warrior one. Arms overhead. Hold here. Feel the strength in your legs.

[SILENCE:10s]

Step back to downward dog. Take a breath.

[SILENCE:5s]

Now step your left foot forward. Back knee down. Hip circles, nice and easy.

[SILENCE:12s]

Reach back for the quad stretch on the right side.

[SILENCE:10s]

Rise into warrior one. Arms up. Hold and breathe.

[SILENCE:10s]

Step back. Walk your feet to your hands. Roll up to standing, one vertebra at a time.

[SILENCE:5s]

Feet hip-width apart. Five bodyweight squats. Slow and controlled. Focus on depth.

[SILENCE:30s]

Now hold at the bottom of a squat. Chest up. Press your knees open with your elbows. Breathe here.

[SILENCE:15s]

Slowly stand. Come back to all fours. We're doing thread the needle for your thoracic spine.

[SILENCE:3s]

Reach your right arm under your left. Let your right shoulder come to the mat. Feel that rotation through your upper back. Hold and breathe.

[SILENCE:10s]

Come back to center. Now left arm threads under. Right shoulder opens to the ceiling. Hold.

[SILENCE:10s]

Back to center. Walk your hands forward into a high plank. Strong and straight from head to heels. Hold here for twenty seconds.

[SILENCE:20s]

Five push-ups. Slow down, slow up. Modify on your knees if you need to.

[SILENCE:30s]

Press back to downward dog. Take a breath.

[SILENCE:5s]

Step your right foot forward. Rise into warrior two. Arms wide. Gaze over your front hand. Hold.

[SILENCE:10s]

Reverse warrior — reach your right arm up and back. Open your side body.

[SILENCE:8s]

Extended side angle — right forearm to right thigh, left arm reaches overhead. Breathe into the length.

[SILENCE:8s]

Cartwheel your hands down. Step back to downward dog. Step your left foot forward. Warrior two.

[SILENCE:10s]

Reverse warrior. Left arm reaches up and back.

[SILENCE:8s]

Extended side angle. Left forearm to left thigh, right arm overhead. Hold and breathe.

[SILENCE:8s]

Hands down. Step back. Walk forward to standing. Mountain pose. Feet together.

[SILENCE:3s]

Shift your weight to your left foot. Place your right foot on your inner calf or thigh. Tree pose. Find a point to focus on.

[SILENCE:12s]

Release. Switch sides. Left foot up. Find your balance.

[SILENCE:12s]

Both feet down. One sun salutation to close.

[SILENCE:2s]

Arms overhead, inhale. Fold forward, exhale. Half lift, flat back. Step back to plank. Lower down slowly. Cobra, lift your chest. Press back to downward dog.

[SILENCE:5s]

Step forward. Half lift. Fold. Rise all the way up, arms overhead. Hands to heart.

[SILENCE:3s]

Close your eyes. Three deep breaths on your own.

[SILENCE:20s]

You showed up today. That's what matters. Your body is awake. Your mind is clear. Go make it a good day.

[SILENCE:3s]

Namaste.
