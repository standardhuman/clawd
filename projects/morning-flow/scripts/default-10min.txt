Welcome to your morning flow.

Find your mat. Close your eyes. Let's begin.

...

Start in child's pose. Knees wide, big toes touching, forehead resting on the mat.

Breathe in deeply through your nose... expanding your lower back.

And slowly breathe out.

Again. Deep breath in...

And let it go.

One more. Fill your lungs completely...

And release everything.

...

Now, come to all fours. We're moving into cat-cow.

Inhale — drop your belly, lift your chest and gaze. Open up.

Exhale — round your spine, tuck your chin, press the floor away.

Inhale... arch and open.

Exhale... round and release.

Keep flowing with your breath. Four more cycles at your own pace.

...

Good. From here, lift your hips up and back into downward dog.

Bend one knee, then the other. Pedal your feet. Feel your calves and ankles waking up.

Press your heels toward the floor, one at a time. No rush.

Keep pedaling for a few more breaths.

...

Now step your right foot forward into a low lunge. Back knee down.

Circle your hips gently... opening up that right hip.

Now reach back with your right hand and grab your left foot for a quad stretch. Breathe into it.

Release the foot. Rise up into warrior one. Arms overhead. Hold here. Feel the strength in your legs.

...

Step back and switch sides. Left foot forward. Back knee down.

Hip circles. Easy and fluid.

Reach back for that quad stretch on the right side.

And rise into warrior one. Arms up. Hold. Breathe.

...

Good. Step back to standing. Feet hip-width apart.

Bodyweight squats. Go at your pace. Five reps. Focus on depth and control.

One... two... three... four... five.

Now hold at the bottom. Chest up. Breathe. Press your knees open with your elbows.

Feel your ankles and hips opening. Hold for three more breaths.

...

Come back to all fours. We're moving into thread the needle for your thoracic spine.

Reach your right arm under your left. Let your right shoulder come to the mat. Feel that rotation through your upper back.

Breathe into the twist.

...

Now switch. Left arm threads under. Right shoulder opens to the ceiling.

Hold and breathe.

...

Come to a high plank. Strong and straight from head to heels.

Hold here for twenty seconds. Breathe steadily.

...

Now lower to your forearms. Forearm plank. Keep your core engaged.

Twenty seconds. You've got this.

...

Good. Drop your right hip toward the mat for a side plank on your forearm. Hold for ten seconds.

Switch to the left side. Ten seconds.

...

Come back to high plank. Five push-ups. Modify on your knees if you need to.

Focus on controlled movement. Slow down, slow up.

One... two... three... four... five.

Nice work.

...

Press back to downward dog. Take a breath.

Now step your right foot forward. Rise into warrior two. Arms wide. Gaze over your front hand.

Hold here. Strong legs, soft shoulders.

...

Reverse warrior — reach your right arm up and back. Open your side body.

Now extended side angle — right forearm to right thigh, left arm reaches overhead. Breathe into the length.

...

Switch sides. Left foot forward. Warrior two.

Reverse warrior. Feel the stretch.

Extended side angle. Hold and breathe.

...

Come to standing. Mountain pose. Feet together.

Shift your weight to your left foot. Place your right foot on your inner calf or thigh. Tree pose.

Find a point to focus on. Breathe. Feel your ankle working to keep you steady.

...

Switch sides. Left foot up. Find your balance.

Hold. Breathe.

...

Let's close with two sun salutation cycles.

Reach your arms overhead. Inhale.

Fold forward. Exhale.

Half lift — flat back. Inhale.

Step or hop back to plank. Exhale.

Lower down slowly. Inhale into cobra — lift your chest.

Exhale — press back to downward dog.

Step forward. Half lift. Fold. And rise all the way up. Arms overhead.

Hands to heart.

One more cycle. Follow your breath.

...

Come to standing. Close your eyes.

Take three deep breaths on your own.

...

You showed up today. That's what matters.

Your body is awake. Your mind is clear. Go make it a good day.

Namaste.
