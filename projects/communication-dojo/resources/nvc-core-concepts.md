# NVC Core Concepts Reference

## The Four Components (OFNR)

### 1. Observation (O)
**What:** Concrete actions we observe that affect our well-being  
**Key:** Separate observation from evaluation

| Evaluation (avoid) | Observation (use) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| "You never listen" | "When I was talking, you looked at your phone" |
| "You're always late" | "The last three times we met, you arrived after the agreed time" |
| "You're inconsiderate" | "When you left the dishes in the sink..." |

### 2. Feelings (F)
**What:** How we feel in relation to what we observe  
**Key:** Distinguish feelings from thoughts/interpretations

**Actual feelings:**
- Happy, sad, scared, angry, surprised, disgusted (basic)
- Peaceful, anxious, frustrated, hopeful, curious, hurt, etc.

**Pseudo-feelings (thoughts disguised as feelings):**
- Abandoned, betrayed, rejected, manipulated, ignored
- These imply what *someone else did* to us

### 3. Needs (N)
**What:** The universal human needs connected to our feelings  
**Key:** Needs are never about specific people, actions, or things

**Categories of needs:**
- **Connection:** love, acceptance, belonging, intimacy, understanding
- **Physical well-being:** food, rest, shelter, safety, touch
- **Honesty:** authenticity, integrity, self-expression
- **Play:** joy, humor, fun
- **Peace:** calm, ease, harmony, order
- **Autonomy:** choice, freedom, independence, space
- **Meaning:** contribution, purpose, growth, creativity

### 4. Request (R)
**What:** Clear, concrete actions that would enrich life  
**Key:** Requests vs demands; present-tense; doable

**Good requests are:**
- Specific and concrete
- Phrased in positive language (what you want, not what you don't)
- Present-tense
- Doable right now
- Open to "no" (otherwise it's a demand)

## The Connected Conversation Process

*[To be filled in from Week 1 materials]*

### Basic Flow:
1. **Self-connection** — What's alive in me?
2. **Express honestly** — Share my observation, feelings, needs
3. **Receive empathically** — Hear their observation, feelings, needs
4. **Request** — What would make life more wonderful?

## Key Distinctions

### Empathy vs. Sympathy
- **Empathy:** Being with someone in their experience ("That sounds really hard")
- **Sympathy:** Adding your own experience ("I know exactly how you feel, when I...")

### Feelings vs. Evaluations
- **Feeling:** "I feel sad"
- **Evaluation:** "I feel like you don't care"

### Needs vs. Strategies
- **Need:** Connection
- **Strategy:** "I need you to call me every day" (this is a specific strategy to meet the need)
