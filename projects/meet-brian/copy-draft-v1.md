# Meet Brian — Copy Draft v1

*For Brian to react to, edit, and make his own. This is a starting point, not a finished product.*

## Option A: First Person, Direct

### Hi, I'm Brian.

I'm 46, I live in Berkeley, and I'm intentionally looking to meet someone.

I'm not on the apps. I've spent enough of my adult life swiping through people and I've come to believe that's not how I want to find a partner. I want to meet someone the old-fashioned way — through people who know us both and think we'd be good together.

If you're reading this, someone who cares about me sent you this link. That means something.

**What my life looks like:**

I spend half my week underwater. I run a hull cleaning business in the East Bay marinas — I dive on boats and keep their bottoms clean. It's physical, it's outside, it's on the water, and I love it. The other half of my week I'm building the software platform for that business.

I sail. I solo raced from San Francisco to Hawaii and back in 2014 — 4,000 miles of open ocean, alone. That trip taught me more about myself than anything else I've done.

I mountain bike fast, technical trails — 20 to 40 miles at a time. My dog Pocket comes with me on rides. She's a big part of my life.

**What matters to me:**

I've done a lot of personal work. I'm in a men's group that meets weekly — The Men's Circle — and that community has been one of the most important things in my life. I practice Nonviolent Communication. I believe in being honest about what I feel and what I need, even when it's uncomfortable.

I value presence. I'm working on putting my phone down more (I even built a website about it). I want a partner who values being *here* — in the conversation, in the room, in the relationship.

I'm curious, I go deep fast, and I'd rather have one real conversation than ten polite ones.

**What I'm looking for:**

Someone who's done their own work. You don't have to have it all figured out — I certainly don't — but you're on the path. You're self-aware. You can name what you're feeling.

Someone active. I'm on the water or on the trails most days. I'd love a partner who wants to come along sometimes — or who has their own thing that lights her up.

Someone who values connection over convenience. Who'd rather meet through a friend than through an algorithm.

**How this works:**

If you're the person who received this link, and something here resonates — reach out. A simple email is perfect. No pressure, no expectations. Just two people seeing if there's something worth exploring.

And if you're one of my friends reading this and someone comes to mind — I'd be grateful for the introduction. Even a simple "hey, I think you two should meet" email is enough.

## Option B: Third Person, Like a Friend Introducing You

### Meet Brian.

If I'm sending you this, it's because I know you both and I think you should meet.

Brian is 46, lives in Berkeley, and is one of the most genuinely present people I know. He runs a hull cleaning business in the East Bay marinas — spends his mornings diving on boats, afternoons building the software platform for his company. He solo sailed to Hawaii and back. He mountain bikes technical trails with his dog. He's the real deal.

He's also deeply committed to personal growth. He's in a men's group, practices Nonviolent Communication, and shows up with a level of honesty and vulnerability that's rare. He's not performing — he's just willing to be real.

Brian's intentionally not on dating apps. He wants to meet someone through people who actually know him — which is why you're reading this.

He's looking for someone who's done their own work, who values presence over performance, and who'd rather go for a hike than scroll through a feed.

If something here lands, reach out to him. Or reach out to me and I'll make the introduction.

## Notes for Brian

**Questions to consider:**
1. First person or third person? (Or a hybrid — you write the main text, with a section like "what my friends say about me"?)
2. Photos — what do you have? Sailing, biking, with Pocket, at an event? Authentic > polished.
3. Contact — email directly? A simple form? Or "reply to the person who sent you this"?
4. Where to host — `briancline.co/meet`? Or something standalone?
5. Do you want to mention the Allison relationship / that you've been single since Dec? (Shows you're not rebounding, you've been processing.)
6. How much of the personal history do you want to share? (The unconventional path — trains, hitchhiking, motorcycle to SF — is compelling and real. The early loss is powerful but deeply personal.)
7. Tone check — does this feel like you, or does it feel like someone trying to sound like you?
