# Meet Brian — Draft v2

*First person. Honest. For Brian to edit and make his own.*

## Hi, I'm Brian.

I'm 46, I live in Berkeley, and I'm looking to meet someone.

I'm not on the apps. I spent most of my adult dating life on them and I've realized that's not how I want to find a partner. The endless scrolling, the sense that there's always someone else around the corner — it doesn't let you appreciate the person in front of you. I'd rather meet someone through people who actually know us both.

If you're reading this, someone who cares about me shared this with you. That already means something.

### What my days look like

I spend half my week underwater. I run a hull cleaning business in the East Bay marinas — I dive on boats and keep their hulls clean. It's physical work, it's on the water, and I love it. The other half of my week I'm building the software platform for that business. I like making things.

I sail. In 2014 I solo raced from San Francisco to Hawaii and back — 4,000 miles of open ocean, alone. It was the hardest and most clarifying thing I've ever done.

I mountain bike fast, technical trails around the East Bay — 20 to 40 miles at a time. My dog Pocket comes along. She's a big part of my life.

I didn't take a traditional path to get here. I traveled the country on freight trains and hitchhiking when I was young, came back to school, studied social psychology, and rode a motorcycle to San Francisco in 2006 with nothing but what I could carry. I've been building a life here ever since.

### What matters to me

I'm in a men's group called The Men's Circle that meets every week. It's one of the most important things in my life. We show up for each other honestly — no performing, no fixing, just presence. I practice Nonviolent Communication and I believe in saying what's real, even when it's uncomfortable.

I've been doing a lot of personal growth work and I'm going to keep doing it. Attachment workshops, improv, community events. I'm showing up to things and meeting people and staying open.

I recently got out of a relationship and I've taken my time with it. I'm not rushing. I'm not rebounding. I'm being intentional about what comes next.

### What I'm looking for

Someone who's curious about themselves. You don't have to have it all figured out — I don't — but you're paying attention to your own life. You notice things. You're willing to go there.

Someone active. I'm on the water or on the trails most days. I'd love a partner who wants to come along sometimes, or who has her own thing that gets her outside and moving.

Someone who values real connection. Who'd rather meet through a friend than through an algorithm. Who puts her phone down at dinner.

### If something resonates

Reach out. A simple email is perfect: [brian@briancline.co]

No pressure. No expectations. Just two people seeing if there's something worth exploring over coffee.

And if you're a friend reading this and someone comes to mind — I'd be grateful for the introduction. Even a simple "I think you two should meet" is enough.

*Notes for Brian:*
- *Where we could add photos: headshot up top, sailing/biking/Pocket scattered through, maybe one at an event or with friends*
- *The freight trains line is great texture — shows you're not conventional without over-explaining*
- *"Puts her phone down at dinner" ties back to Appreciating Serenity without being heavy*
- *Contact: brian@briancline.co or do you prefer standardhuman@gmail.com?*
- *We could add a small "What my friends say" section later if any TMC guys want to contribute a line*
