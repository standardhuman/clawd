## Content Creation

### Content Types & Templates

**Blog Post:**
1. Headline — clear, benefit-driven, includes primary keyword (aim for ≤60 chars for SEO). Provide 2-3 options.
2. Introduction (100-150 words) — hook with a question, statistic, bold claim, or story. Include primary keyword.
3. Body sections (3-5) — each with descriptive H2. One core idea per section with evidence/examples.
4. Conclusion (75-100 words) — summarize takeaways, CTA.
5. Meta description — under 160 chars, includes keyword, compels click.

**Social Media:**
- Hook in the first line
- 2-4 concise points or short narrative
- CTA or engagement prompt
- 3-5 relevant hashtags
- Platform-specific: LinkedIn (professional, paragraph breaks, ~1,300 chars), Twitter/X (punchy, within char limit), Instagram (visual-first, story-driven)

**Email Newsletter:**
- Subject line (2-3 options, under 50 chars)
- Preview text (complements, doesn't repeat subject)
- 2-3 scannable body sections
- One primary CTA
- Mobile-first design

**Landing Page:**
- Headline (primary benefit, under 10 words) + subheadline
- 3-4 benefit-driven value props
- Social proof section
- FAQ / objection handling
- Primary CTA above the fold, repeated at bottom
- Meta title + description suggestions

**Press Release:**
- Headline, dateline, lead paragraph (who/what/when/where/why)
- Supporting quotes, body paragraphs
- Company boilerplate, media contact

**Case Study:**
- Title: "[Customer] achieves [result] with [product]"
- Challenge → Solution → Results (with metrics) → Quote → CTA

### Writing Best Practices
- Blog: 8th-grade reading level for broad audiences, short paragraphs (2-4 sentences), subheadings every 200-300 words
- Active voice, front-load key info
- Social: LinkedIn ~1,300 chars, Twitter punchy, Instagram visual-first
- Email: personalize, one primary CTA, bold key phrases, mobile-first
- Web: lead with benefits not features, "you" language, minimize jargon

### Headline Formulas
- "How to [achieve result] [without common obstacle]"
- "[Number] [adjective] ways to [achieve result]"
- "Why [common belief] is wrong (and what to do instead)"
- "The [adjective] guide to [topic]"
- "[Do this], not [that]"
- "What [impressive result] taught us about [topic]"

### Hook Formulas
- Surprising statistic
- Contrarian statement
- Question
- Scenario / "Imagine..."
- Bold claim
- Story opening

### CTA Best Practices
- Action verbs: "Get", "Start", "Download", "Join", "Try"
- Be specific: "Start your free trial" > "Submit"
- Reduce risk: "No credit card required", "Cancel anytime"
- One primary CTA per page/email

## Campaign Planning

### Framework: Objective → Audience → Message → Channel → Measure

**1. Objective (SMART):**
- Awareness (reach, impressions)
- Consideration (engagement, signups)
- Conversion (leads, sales, pipeline)
- Retention (churn reduction, upsell)
- Advocacy (referrals, reviews)

**2. Audience:**
> "[Role] at [company type] who is struggling with [pain point] and looking for [desired outcome]. They typically discover solutions through [channels] and care most about [priorities]."

**3. Message:**
- Core message (one sentence)
- 3-4 supporting messages
- Proof points for each
- Differentiation statement

**4. Channel Selection:**

| Channel Type | Examples | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Owned | Blog, email, social profiles, webinars | SEO, nurture, community |
| Earned | PR, guest content, reviews, community | Credibility, reach |
| Paid | Search ads, social ads, display, sponsored | Lead gen, awareness |

**5. Measure:** See Performance Analytics section below.

### Content Calendar
| Date | Content Piece | Channel | Audience Segment | Theme | Owner | Status |
|------|--------------|---------|-------------------|-------|-------|--------|

Planning process: Start with milestones → work backward → map to funnel stages → batch by theme → balance channels → leave 20% flexibility.

### Budget Allocation (Starting Framework)
| Category | % of Budget |
|---|---|
| Paid acquisition | 30-40% |
| Content production | 20-30% |
| Events/sponsorships | 10-20% |
| Tools/technology | 10-15% |
| Testing/experimentation | 5-10% |

## Brand Voice

### Brand Voice Documentation
1. **Brand Personality** — define the brand as a person
2. **Voice Attributes** (3-5) — each with "we are / we are not / sounds like / doesn't sound like"
3. **Audience Awareness** — who you speak to and how
4. **Core Messaging Pillars** — 3-5 themes, hierarchically ordered
5. **Tone Spectrum** — how voice adapts across contexts
6. **Style Rules** — grammar, formatting, language choices
7. **Terminology** — preferred/avoided terms, product names, inclusive language

### Tone by Channel
| Channel | Tone |
|---|---|
| Blog | Informative, conversational, educational |
| LinkedIn | Professional, thought-provoking |
| Twitter/X | Punchy, direct, sometimes witty |
| Email | Personal, helpful, action-oriented |
| Support/Help | Clear, patient, step-by-step |
| Press release | Formal, factual |
| Error messages | Empathetic, helpful, blame-free |

### Brand Review Workflow
For each piece of content, evaluate:
1. Voice and tone consistency
2. Terminology and language compliance
3. Messaging pillar alignment
4. Style guide compliance (grammar, formatting, punctuation)
5. Legal/compliance flags: unsubstantiated claims, missing disclaimers, comparative claims

Rate issues as **High** (contradicts brand, compliance risk), **Medium** (inconsistent), or **Low** (minor style preference).

## Competitive Analysis

### Research Sources
- **Primary:** Website, blog, social media, product demos, webinars, press releases, job postings
- **Secondary:** Review sites (G2, Capterra), analyst reports, news, SEO tools, financial filings, community forums

### Messaging Comparison Matrix
| Dimension | Your Company | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tagline | | | |
| Core value prop | | | |
| Target buyer | | | |
| Key differentiator | | | |
| Tone/voice | | | |
| Proof points | | | |

### Positioning Map
Plot competitors on a 2x2 using the two most important market dimensions:
- Price vs. Capability
- Ease of Use vs. Power
- SMB vs. Enterprise
- Point Solution vs. Platform

### Battlecard Structure
- Quick overview (what they do, target customer, pricing)
- Their pitch (tagline, top 3 claimed differentiators)
- Strengths (be honest)
- Weaknesses (from reviews, gaps)
- Your differentiators (with proof)
- Objection handling table
- Landmines to set (questions that highlight your advantages)
- Win/loss themes

## Email Sequences

### Sequence Types & Templates

**Onboarding (5-7 emails, 14-21 days):**
Welcome → Quick win → Core feature → Advanced feature → Social proof → Check-in → Upgrade prompt

**Lead Nurture (4-6 emails, 3-4 weeks):**
Educational value → Pain point → Solution + proof → Social proof → Soft CTA → Direct CTA

**Re-engagement (3-4 emails, 10-14 days):**
"We miss you" → Value reminder → Incentive → Last chance

**Win-back (3-5 emails, 30 days):**
Check-in → What's new → Special offer → Feedback request → Final goodbye

**Product Launch (4-6 emails, 2-3 weeks):**
Teaser → Launch announcement → Feature spotlight → Social proof → Limited offer → Reminder

### Per-Email Structure
- Subject line (2-3 options)
- Preview text (40-90 chars, complements subject)
- Email purpose (one sentence)
- Full body copy (short paragraphs, personalization tokens)
- Primary CTA (button text + destination)
- Timing (days after trigger or previous email)
- Segment/condition notes

### Sequence Logic
- Branching conditions (e.g., opened but didn't click → softer re-ask)
- Exit conditions (conversion = remove from sequence)
- Re-entry rules
- Suppression rules (don't send if in another active sequence, contacted support recently, etc.)

### Performance Benchmarks
| Metric | Onboarding | Lead Nurture | Re-engagement | Win-back |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Open rate | 50-70% | 20-30% | 15-25% | 15-20% |
| CTR | 10-20% | 3-7% | 2-5% | 2-4% |
| Conversion | 15-30% | 2-5% | 3-8% | 1-3% |
| Unsubscribe | <0.5% | <0.5% | 1-2% | 1-3% |

## SEO Audit

### Keyword Research
For each opportunity, assess:
- Search volume signals (high/medium/low)
- Keyword difficulty (easy/moderate/hard)
- Intent (informational, navigational, commercial, transactional)
- Long-tail and question-based variations

### On-Page SEO Checklist
| Element | Target |
|---|---|
| Title tag | ≤60 chars, includes primary keyword |
| Meta description | ≤160 chars, includes keyword, compels click |

| Keyword in first 100 words | Yes |
| Internal links | 2-3 to related content |
| Image alt text | Descriptive, keyword where relevant |
| URL structure | Clean, readable, includes keyword |

### Content Gap Analysis
- Topics competitors cover that you don't
- Content freshness (pages not updated in 12+ months)
- Thin content (under 300 words for informational queries)
- Missing formats (guides, comparisons, glossaries, tools)
- Funnel gaps (missing content at awareness/consideration/decision stages)
- Topic cluster opportunities (pillar + supporting content)

### Technical SEO
- Page speed, mobile-friendliness
- Structured data / schema markup opportunities
- robots.txt, XML sitemap, canonical tags
- Broken links, redirect chains
- HTTPS, Core Web Vitals

### Output: Prioritized Action Plan
