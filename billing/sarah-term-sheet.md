#sailorskills #business #contract #sarah

### Term Sheet — Draft for Discussion
**Date:** February 9, 2026
**Between:** Brian Cline (SailorSkills) and Sarah [Last Name]

---

## 1. Role

W-2 employee performing hull cleaning services for SailorSkills clients in the East Bay marinas.

---

## 2. What SailorSkills Provides

- **Mobile Diving Platform** — proprietary system (3+ years of R&D) enabling 2-4x efficiency vs. traditional setups; no need to exit the water between boats
- **All Equipment** — diving gear, cleaning tools, mobile platform, maintenance & replacements (employee provides own wetsuit)
- **Client Book** — access to 90+ established recurring clients, all within a single marina
- **SailorSkills Pro** — full admin system for scheduling, service logging, condition tracking, and automated Stripe invoicing
- **Training & Mentorship** — commercial diving techniques, hull cleaning best practices, client management, safety protocols
- **Workers' Compensation Insurance** — full coverage for on-the-job injuries
- **Payroll through Gusto** — taxes withheld automatically, no quarterly filing hassle

---

## 3. Why W-2 (Not 1099)

California's AB5 law requires the ABC test for contractor classification. Because hull cleaning *is* SailorSkills' core business, a contractor arrangement fails Prong B of the ABC test. W-2 is the legally compliant structure — and it's actually better for both sides.

### The ABC Test (California AB5)

All three must pass for 1099 status. If ANY fails, the worker must be W-2:

| Prong | Test | Result |
|-------|------|--------|
| A | Worker free from control/direction | ⚠️ Arguable |
| B | Work is OUTSIDE the hiring entity's usual business | ❌ Fails — hull cleaning IS the business |
| C | Worker has independently established trade/business | ❌ Fails — Sarah doesn't run her own operation |

### Why W-2 Is Better for Sarah

| | 1099 Contractor | W-2 Employee |
|---|---|---|
| FICA tax burden | 15.3% (both halves) | 7.65% (employer pays other half) |
| Effective tax rate | ~25% | ~20% |
| Gross needed to net $2,700/mo | ~$4,000 | ~$3,400 |
| Workers' comp if injured | ❌ None | ✅ Covered |
| Unemployment if let go | ❌ None | ✅ Covered |
| CA Disability Insurance (SDI) | ❌ None | ✅ Covered |
| Paid Family Leave | ❌ None | ✅ Covered |
| Paid sick leave | ❌ None | ✅ 5 days/year |
| Quarterly tax filings | Yes, you handle it | No, Gusto handles everything |

**Bottom line: Same 50% rate, Sarah keeps ~$500/month more as W-2 and gets full benefits.**

---

## 4. Compensation — 50% Revenue Share

| | |
|---|---|
| **Rate** | 50% of the gross revenue for each boat serviced |
| **Average payout** | ~$75/boat (based on $149 avg revenue) |
| **Range** | ~$50/boat (small/discounted) to ~$125+/boat (large vessels) |
| **Payroll** | Bi-weekly through Gusto, taxes withheld automatically |

That's it. One number. Simple and transparent.

### Why This Structure Works

- **"You get half"** — simple, fair, easy to understand
- **Per-boat piece rate** — incentivizes efficiency, not stretching out jobs
- **Revenue share** — naturally adjusts as prices increase over time
- **Scales with boat size** — bigger boats pay more, proportionally
- **No hourly component** — autonomous underwater work shouldn't reward slow pace
- **Growth is built in** — more clients = more boats = more money for both sides

### Why Not Hourly?

Hull cleaning is autonomous underwater work with no supervision while diving. Hourly pay would incentivize stretching out jobs. Per-boat piece rate aligns incentives: fast, thorough work = more boats = more money.

---

## 5. What Sarah Takes Home (W-2 vs 1099)

### Per Boat (at $149 avg revenue)

| | 1099 | W-2 |
|---|---|---|
| Gross pay (50%) | $74.50 | $74.50 |
| Self-employment tax (15.3%) | -$11.40 | — |
| Employee FICA (7.65%) | — | -$5.70 |
| CA SDI (1.3%) | — | -$0.97 |
| Federal + state income tax | -$7.10 | -$8.20 |
| **Net per boat** | **~$56** | **~$60** |

Sarah keeps ~$4 more per boat as W-2, plus gets benefits.

### Monthly Income at Different Volumes

| Boats/week | Boats/month | Gross/month | Net take-home (W-2) | Covers $2,700 living? |
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 4 | 17 | $1,300 | $1,055 | ❌ Supplement needed |
| 6 | 26 | $1,950 | $1,560 | ❌ Supplement needed |
| 8 | 35 | $2,600 | $2,080 | ❌ Getting close |
| 10 | 43 | $3,250 | $2,620 | ⚠️ Nearly there |
| 11 | 48 | $3,575 | $2,895 | ✅ Yes |
| 12 | 52 | $3,900 | $3,130 | ✅ Yes + buffer |

**Key: As 1099, Sarah calculated she'd need 12-13 boats/week to cover living costs. As W-2, she only needs 11.**

---

## 6. Ramp-Up Plan (March — August 2026)

| Month | Phase | Boats/week | Gross/month | Net/month |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| March | Training — ride-alongs, all work verified | 2-3 | ~$810 | ~$710 |
| April | Supervised — solo dives, Brian verifies all | 4-6 | ~$1,620 | ~$1,380 |
| May | Growing — Brian spot-checks ~50% | 6-8 | ~$2,270 | ~$1,880 |
| June | Independent — periodic check-ins | 8-10 | ~$2,920 | ~$2,370 |
| July+ | Full pace — fully independent | 10-12 | ~$3,570 | ~$2,860 |

**Timeline to cover living costs: ~Month 5 (July), consistent with Sarah's 3-6 month target.**

Early months will require supplemental income. The per-boat structure means Sarah only earns as capacity grows — no pressure to take on more than she's ready for, and plenty of flexibility for her IBS business.

**Client introduction strategy:**
1. Brian introduces Sarah during ride-along dives
2. Brief client notification before Sarah's first solo visit
3. Start with simpler, smaller boats — work up to larger/complex hulls
4. Brian retains highest-value and relationship-sensitive clients initially

---

## 7. Work Standards

- Service quality must meet SailorSkills standards (training provided)
- Service logs completed in SailorSkills Pro after each dive
- Client communication follows SailorSkills guidelines
- Brian may spot-check work at any time, especially during ramp-up
- Any client complaints are addressed jointly

---

## 8. Schedule & Availability

- Flexible scheduling within marina operating hours
- Boats assigned by mutual agreement based on capacity
- Minimum commitment: *[to discuss — e.g., 3 dive days/week during ramp]*
- No travel between sites — all clients within one marina
- Structure supports Sarah's goal of having time for her IBS business

---

## 9. W-2 Benefits (Included)

| Benefit | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Workers' Compensation | Full coverage for on-the-job injuries (critical for diving) |
| Employer FICA | SailorSkills pays 7.65% — Sarah pays only 7.65% instead of 15.3% |
| CA Unemployment Insurance | Benefits available if employment ends |
| CA State Disability (SDI) | Short-term disability coverage |
| Paid Family Leave (PFL) | Through CA SDI program |
| Paid Sick Leave | 5 days (40 hours) per year |
| Payroll Processing | All withholding and filing handled through Gusto |

---

## 10. Confidentiality & Intellectual Property

### Trade Secrets & Confidential Information

The following are proprietary to SailorSkills and must not be disclosed or used outside the scope of employment:

- **Client list** — names, contact info, boat details, service schedules, pricing
- **Service records** — condition history, cleaning logs, client preferences
- **Pricing structure** — rates, discounts, special arrangements
- **Business systems** — SailorSkills Pro platform, scheduling methods, route planning
- **Operational methods** — proprietary mobile diving platform design and techniques

Employee agrees to:
- Not disclose confidential information to any third party during or after employment
- Not use confidential information for personal business purposes
- Return all company data, records, and platform access upon termination
- Not copy, download, or retain client lists, schedules, or pricing information

### Company Property & Equipment Use

All equipment, tools, platform components, and digital access provided by SailorSkills remain company property. Upon termination for any reason, employee will promptly return all company property and relinquish access to SailorSkills Pro and all business systems.

**SailorSkills equipment may only be used for servicing SailorSkills clients.** Employee may not use company equipment, platform, or tools to service boats or clients outside of SailorSkills assignments. Any new client opportunities discovered while working should be brought to SailorSkills — not serviced independently using company resources.

---

## 11. Non-Solicitation & Post-Employment

### Non-Solicitation of Clients

For a period of **12 months** following the end of employment, employee agrees not to:

- **Directly or indirectly solicit, contact, or service** any client who was a SailorSkills client during the employee's tenure
- **Accept work from** any SailorSkills client who contacts the employee, without written consent from SailorSkills
- **Divert or attempt to divert** any SailorSkills client to a competing service

This applies to clients the employee personally serviced AND clients the employee had access to through SailorSkills Pro or other company systems.

### Non-Solicitation of Employees

For 12 months following the end of employment, employee agrees not to recruit or solicit any SailorSkills employee or contractor to leave SailorSkills.

### What This Does NOT Restrict

Per California Business & Professions Code §16600:
- Employee **may** work as a diver for any other company or independently
- Employee **may** service boats and clients that were never SailorSkills clients
- Employee **may** build their own business in a different marina or geography
- This is a **non-solicitation** clause, not a non-compete — it protects specific client relationships, not the right to work

### Why This Is Fair

SailorSkills is investing significantly in training, equipment access, client introductions, and a proprietary platform. The non-solicitation protects that investment while still allowing the employee full freedom to work in the diving industry. The restriction is narrow (specific clients, 12 months) and does not prevent earning a living.

---

## 12. Term & Termination

| | |
|---|---|
| **Initial term** | 6 months (through August 2026) |
| **Renewal** | Month-to-month after initial term |
| **Notice** | 30 days written notice by either party |
| **Termination for cause** | Immediate, for safety violations, theft, or client harm |

---

## 13. SailorSkills' Competitive Advantages (What Stays with the Company)

For context on why this arrangement works for both sides — and what an employee would lose by going solo:

| Asset | Provided by SailorSkills | Cost/Effort to Replicate Solo |
|-------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Mobile diving platform | ✅ Included | 1-2 years R&D + $10K+ to build |
| 90+ recurring client base | ✅ Included | Years of door-to-door sales |
| SailorSkills Pro admin system | ✅ Included | Build or buy billing/scheduling software |
| Automated Stripe invoicing | ✅ Included | Set up merchant account + billing system |
| All diving equipment | ✅ Included | $5,000-10,000 to purchase |
| Workers' comp insurance | ✅ Included | $3,000-6,000/year if you can get it solo |
| Payroll & tax handling | ✅ Included | Quarterly filings, self-employment tax (+7.65%) |
| Training & mentorship | ✅ Included | Learn through trial and error |
| Marina relationships | ✅ Included | Build from scratch |

**The deal:** Sarah gets 50% of revenue with zero overhead, zero risk, and full benefits. Going solo means 100% of revenue but 100% of costs, admin, equipment, insurance, billing, and marketing — with no client base to start.

---

## 14. Current Business Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Active clients | 92 boats |
| Avg. boats serviced/month | 43 |
| Avg. revenue per service | $149 |
| Avg. monthly revenue | ~$6,400 |
| Avg. in-water time per boat | 36 min (Brian's pace) |
| Service intervals | 15% monthly, 37% bimonthly, 36% quarterly |
| Client location | Single marina |

---

## 15. Steady State (Fall 2026+)

**With moderate client growth (+3-5 new clients/month):**

| | Sarah | Brian |
|---|---|---|
| Boats/month | 40-48 | 10-15 |
| Gross monthly income | $3,000-3,600 | $4,200-4,600 |
| Net monthly take-home | $2,400-2,900 | Before Brian's own taxes |
| In-water hours/month | 30-40 hrs | 6-10 hrs |

**Brian's income at steady state:**
- Direct diving (15 boats × $149): ~$2,235
- From Sarah's boats (40 × ~$61 net after employer costs): ~$2,454
- **Total: ~$4,689/month** while diving ~65% less than current

**The tradeoff:** ~$1,700/month less income, but ~28 fewer boats/month of underwater work. That's time for platform development, business growth, and quality of life.

## 16. True Cost Analysis & Margin Review (Updated 2/11/2026)

### Per-Boat Economics (at $149 avg revenue)

| Line Item | Amount | % of Revenue |
|---|---|---|
| Gross revenue | $149.00 | 100% |
| Sarah's gross (50%) | -$74.50 | 50.0% |
| Employer FICA (7.65%) | -$5.70 | 3.8% |
| CA UI + ETT (~1.5%) | -$1.12 | 0.8% |
| Workers' comp (standard CA, ~3%) | -$2.24 | 1.5% |
| Workers' comp (maritime USL&H, ~9%) | -$6.71 | 4.5% |
| **Brian's net/boat (standard WC)** | **$65.44** | **43.9%** |
| **Brian's net/boat (maritime WC)** | **$62.09** | **41.7%** |

### What Sarah Actually Takes Home

- **Per boat (after all withholdings):** ~$59.63
- **At 1 boat/hour:** ~$60/hr net after tax
- **At 2 boats/hour (common for adjacent boats):** ~$120/hr net after tax
- **Comparable W-2 work:** Commercial divers in CA average $25-35/hr gross (~$20-28 net)
- **Sarah's effective rate is 2-4x market for comparable W-2 physical work**

### Monthly at Sarah's Target Volume (43 boats)

| | 50% + Std WC | 50% + Maritime WC | 45% + Std WC | 45% + Maritime WC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sarah's gross | $3,204 | $3,204 | $2,883 | $2,883 |
| Total employer costs | $389 | $580 | $350 | $522 |
| **Brian's net** | **$2,814** | **$2,623** | **$3,935** | **$3,744** |
| **Brian's effective %** | **43.9%** | **40.9%** | **51.5%** | **49.0%** |
| Sarah's net take-home | ~$2,563 | ~$2,563 | ~$2,307 | ~$2,307 |
| Sarah's effective $/hr (at 2 boats/hr) | ~$120 | ~$120 | ~$108 | ~$108 |

### Revenue Share Comparison (Annual Impact)

| Share | Brian's annual net (43 boats/mo, std WC) | Difference vs 50% |
|---|---|---|
| 50% | $33,768 | — |
| 47.5% | $35,838 | +$2,070 |
| 45% | $47,220 | +$13,452 |

### Strategic Considerations

**For staying at 50%:**
- Simple, memorable — "we split it"
- Maximum retention power against competing interests (Sarah's IBS business, other work)
- Goodwill with someone who lives on Brian's dock
- Motivated employee grows the client book faster (growth benefits both sides)

**For adjusting to 45%:**
- Still $108/hr net for Sarah at 2 boats/hour — 3-4x market for W-2 physical work
- Extra $13K/year covers Brian's overdue 2024 tax liability
- More accurately reflects the value of platform, equipment, client book, and insurance Brian provides
- Industry norm for this package is 35-40%, so 45% is still generous

**Pending:** Broker response on WC type (standard vs maritime) will swing monthly costs by ~$190.

**Decision: TBD — waiting on insurance broker response before finalizing.**
