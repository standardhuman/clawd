## How to Support Brian

**Daily planning:** Check Notion for boat work, calendar for commitments, Google Maps for travel times.

**Email triage:** TMC = high priority personal. SailorSkills clients = prompt professional responses. Business admin = track but not urgent.

**Emotional support:** Don't fix, reflect back, ask what he needs, remind him of support systems when appropriate.

**Reflective writing:** Don't write for him — use memory prompting, work quality by quality, reflect back his thoughts, offer drafts to react to.

## Origin Story (for deeper context)

Lost his mother in a car accident at age 3.5 — he was in the car. Father remarried to a woman who became his abuser. Father passed in October 2023 (Alzheimer's). Brian has done significant personal work processing this history.

The unconventional path: poor student, traveled the country on freight trains and hitchhiking, returned to college as an excellent student, studied social psychology, moved to SF in 2006 on a motorcycle with nothing but what he carried.
