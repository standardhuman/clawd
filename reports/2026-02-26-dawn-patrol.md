## 🌊 WELLBEING

Yesterday was a massive org day — no movement logged, all screen time. TMC circle last night was good for the soul, but your body needs attention today.

- **Today's move:** Morning mobility flow before you hit the water. Focus on thoracic spine and hip flexors — you've got 10 boats to clean and your back will thank you.
- **Recovery note:** You're diving today after a desk day. Warm up extra — cold muscles + cold water = injury risk.
- **Hydrate:** Start now. You were probably underhydrated yesterday staring at screens. 32oz before you leave the house.

## 🧭 PILLARS & FOCUS

### 🎯 Today's Top Actions
1. **Set Stripe test key** for Pro Build 51 — `npx supabase secrets set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_XXXXX --project-ref dxyzxcmhhhepjndxunwx` (blocks field test Saturday)
2. **Dive day** — 10 boats at BRK Dock O, starting 11:15 AM. Test Build 51 on at least one dive if Stripe key is set.
3. **Call a CPA** — March 15 is 17 days out. S-Corp return won't file itself. Three candidates identified, zero contacted.
4. **Add Blake to TestFlight** — he can't review Build 51 code without tester access in App Store Connect
5. **Crew Party prep** — 7 days out. Business cards? Elevator pitch rehearsed? Site loaded on phone?

### ⚠️ At Risk
- **🔴 2024 personal tax return** — ~11 months overdue, ~$12K with penalties, no CPA hired
- **🔴 2025 S-Corp return** — due March 15 (17 days), CPA needed
- **🟠 AI costs** — $1,600/mo projected vs $200/mo target (8x over)
- **🟠 All agents operational** — non-Howard agents broken (DeepSeek key expired)

### 📅 This Week
- **Sat Feb 28** — Pro Build 51 field test (needs Stripe key set first)
- **Thu Mar 5** — Latitude 38 Crew Party launch event
- **Sun Mar 15** — S-Corp return deadline

## 💡 TODAY'S PITCH

**Use Simon Willison's Claude Code Remote Control review as your competitive positioning post.**

Yesterday Simon Willison reviewed Anthropic's new Claude Code Remote Control and explicitly wrote: *"It's interesting to then contrast this to solutions like OpenClaw."* He called out everything it can't do that yours already does — no scheduling, no persistence, breaks on restart.

- **Why now:** His audience = your ideal consulting clients. The "Ask HN" thread 2 days ago showed people paying $75/week for Claws. Market is forming.
- **What to do:** Write "What Simon Got Right About Claude Code Remote Control (And What I Built Instead)" with screenshots of your actual setup
- **Next step:** Draft the outline today between dives. Publish within 48 hours while his post is still circulating.
- **Pillar:** 💡 Pillar 6 (Building the Future) — brand, content, consulting pipeline

## 📬 TRIAGE

### Email
- **Communication Dojo** — Daily Post #18: "What if the other person wants to fight?" (read when ready, not urgent)
- **Frontier Tower SF** — "Connecting with Emotion" event starting tomorrow. Aligns with Pillar 7 (Partnership) — worth registering?
- **Wealthfront** — Monthly statement available
- **Google Apps Script** — failure notification (check if it's your email digest script)
- No urgent client emails. No replies needed this morning.

### Calendar
- Calendar API returned permissions error — check Google OAuth scopes when you have a minute
