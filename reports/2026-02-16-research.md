- **Summary:** Released February 5, Opus 4.6 improves coding, sustained task performance, and professional work output quality. New "agent teams" feature enables coordinated multi-agent workflows. Described as advancing a "vibe working" paradigm.
- **Relevance:** This is our current model. The agent teams capability could enhance Howard's multi-agent orchestration. Improved sustained task performance directly benefits long-running automated workflows.

### Anthropic-Pentagon Dispute Over Claude Military Usage
- **Source:** https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/anthropic-and-the-pentagon-are-reportedly-arguing-over-claude-usage/
- **Summary:** Reports indicate Claude was used in a US military operation in Venezuela via Anthropic's Palantir partnership. Anthropic is pushing back, asserting hard limits around autonomous weapons and mass surveillance. The company says it's focused on "Usage Policy questions."
- **Relevance:** Worth monitoring for potential policy changes that could affect Claude's capabilities or terms of service. Anthropic's stance on usage boundaries may influence future model access restrictions.

### GitHub Agent HQ: Multi-Agent Development in VS Code
- **Source:** https://www.infoworld.com/article/4130352/github-previews-support-for-claude-and-codex-coding-agents.html
- **Summary:** GitHub's Agent HQ (announced Feb 4) lets Copilot Pro+ and Enterprise users run Claude, Codex, and Copilot simultaneously in VS Code and GitHub. The January 2026 VS Code release (v1.109) introduces session management for orchestrating multiple AI assistants.
- **Relevance:** Multi-agent development is going mainstream. This validates the architectural direction of using specialized agents for different tasks. Could accelerate SailorSkills platform development with concurrent agent assistance.

### Google Launches Gemini 3 Deep Think
- **Source:** https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/gemini-models/gemini-3-deep-think/
- **Summary:** Google released an upgraded Deep Think reasoning mode for Gemini 3, targeted at science, research, and engineering challenges. Available to AI Ultra subscribers and via early access API. Duke University is already using it for research applications.
