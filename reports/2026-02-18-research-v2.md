## 🔑 Top 3 Opportunities
1. **AI Productivity Paradox reveals "workslop" problem** — CEOs report no productivity gains from AI because it's automating bullshit work, not valuable work. Opportunity: Build tools that help companies identify and eliminate low-value work before automating it.
2. **Community Notes pattern for Discord communities** — Open Notes applies X's Community Notes to Discord, letting communities add context to disputed claims. This "AI-assisted human moderation" model could work for any community platform.
3. **CEL (Common Expression Language) as lightweight business logic layer** — Used by Kubernetes, Google Cloud IAM, Firebase, Envoy. Could replace complex custom validation code in SailorSkills with declarative CEL expressions.

## 💡 AI Business Opportunities

### AI Productivity Paradox: Automating Bullshit Work
- **Source:** https://fortune.com/2026/02/17/ai-productivity-paradox-ceo-study-robert-solow-information-technology-age/
- **Idea:** Study of 6,000 CEOs finds AI has had no impact on employment or productivity. Reason: AI is automating "bullshit work" (reports nobody reads, compliance paperwork) rather than valuable work. This creates an opportunity for tools that help companies identify low-value work BEFORE automating it.
- **Why now:** As AI adoption grows, companies are realizing they're automating the wrong things. Tools that audit work value could become essential.
- **Effort to test:** Medium — could build a simple "work value assessment" framework that analyzes meeting notes, document traffic, and task completion patterns.

### Community Notes Pattern for Community Platforms
- **Source:** https://opennotes.ai/discord-bot
- **Idea:** Open Notes brings X's Community Notes system to Discord — AI surfaces disputed claims, community adds context, consensus determines what gets shown. This "AI-assisted human moderation" reduces moderator burnout while maintaining trust.
- **Why now:** Community moderation at scale is breaking down. This pattern could work for forums, Slack communities, even internal company communications.
- **Effort to test:** Low — could prototype a simple version for a SailorSkills client community or internal team Discord.

### Math-Native OS as Research Platform
- **Source:** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47061315
- **Idea:** Axiom OS is a Linux distro built from scratch with a math-native shell (x² is valid syntax) and a Nash Equilibrium-based scheduler. Built by a 19-year-old aerospace student. Not immediately commercial, but shows what's possible when rethinking OS fundamentals for mathematical computation.
- **Why now:** As AI agents become more mathematical in reasoning, having OS-level support could be a competitive advantage.
- **Effort to test:** High — research project only, but worth tracking as a potential future platform.

## ⚓ SailorSkills Augmentation

### CEL (Common Expression Language) for Business Logic
- **Source:** https://celbyexample.com/
- **Summary:** CEL is a portable expression language used by Kubernetes (admission control), Google Cloud IAM, Firebase security rules, and Envoy Proxy. It evaluates expressions against data (JSON, Protobuf) — fast, safe, sandboxed.
- **Action:** Replace custom validation logic in SailorSkills with CEL expressions. Example: "client.subscription_status == 'active' && client.balance >= 0". Could be used for pricing rules, access control, scheduling constraints. Self-contained, auditable, testable.

### VectorNest: Lightweight SVG Editing for Marine Diagrams
- **Source:** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47062096
- **Summary:** Open-source, browser-based SVG editor for quick edits (paths, alignment, animations, LLM assistance). No installation needed.
- **Action:** Could embed in SailorSkills dashboard for clients to annotate hull condition diagrams, mark damage areas, or customize service reports. Lightweight alternative to full CAD tools.

### Anna's Archive LLM-Friendly Data Access
- **Source:** https://annas-archive.li/blog/llms-txt.html
- **Summary:** Anna's Archive (non-profit knowledge preservation) publishes an `llms.txt` file explaining how LLMs should interact with their site: download bulk data via torrents/API instead of scraping, consider donating if trained on their data.
- **Action:** Model for how SailorSkills could expose data to AI agents — structured access patterns, clear terms, enterprise API tiers. Could be a revenue stream if agents are using our marine service data for training.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods

### Rodney v0.4.0 Updates (Browser Automation)
- **Source:** https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/17/rodney/
- **What it does:** Simon Willison's CLI browser automation tool gets directory-scoped sessions, `rodney assert` for JS tests, `rodney connect` for debugging existing Chrome instances, Windows support, and exit code improvements.
- **How we'd use it:** Even better for automated testing of web UIs built by coding agents. The `assert` command lets agents write self-validating test scripts.

### Cognitive Debt vs. Technical Debt
- **Source:** Simon Willison blog (multiple entries on cognitive debt)
- **What it does:** New concept: when AI makes coding fast but humans lose understanding of the system. "Cognitive debt" accumulates when teams can't explain why design decisions were made or how system parts work together.
- **How we'd use it:** Framework for evaluating agent-built code. Need to ensure Howard and other agents maintain system understanding, not just produce working code. Could implement "cognitive debt audits" in our development process.

### Qwen3.5: 397B MoE Model with 17B Active Parameters
- **Source:** Simon Willison blog
- **What it does:** Alibaba's Qwen3.5-397B-A17B is a Mixture of Experts model where only 17B parameters activate per forward pass. Open weights, multi-modal (vision), 807GB on Hugging Face.
- **How we'd use it:** For cost-sensitive inference tasks where we need vision capabilities. The MoE architecture means lower inference cost despite large model size.

## 🔍 New Sources Discovered
- **Fawaz Ishola** — 19-year-old aerospace student building Axiom OS (math-native Linux). Worth tracking as an extreme talent in systems programming.
- **Anna's Archive team** — Non-profit knowledge preservation with thoughtful AI/LLM engagement policies. Model for ethical data access.
- **CEL (Common Expression Language) community** — Lightweight business logic language with major industry adoption (Kubernetes, Google Cloud, Firebase).
