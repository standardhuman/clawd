# 🌅 Dawn Patrol — Tuesday, February 24, 2026

## 🌊 WELLBEING

Yesterday was a big platform dev day — OTel, 89 tests, navbar redesign, provider curation, service areas, two Pro builds. No workout logged. That's fine — your body got a rest day whether you planned it or not.

- **Today's move:** You've got Tilden Park Trail Run at 6:15pm — that's your cardio. Morning is WFH with sprint meetings, so squeeze in a 10-min mobility flow before your first call (hip flexors + thoracic spine — you've been at the desk).
- **Hydration nudge:** Coffee's great. Water before the run is better. 💧
- **Tonight:** Communication Dojo 7-9pm in person. Good week to have that after a heavy build sprint.

## 🧭 PILLARS & FOCUS

### 🎯 Today's Top Actions
1. **🔴 Call CPA** — Dimov, Mary Geong, or Chang. Tax returns are the most overdue item in your life. 2024 personal is ~10 months late (~$12K with penalties). 2025 S-Corp due March 15 — 19 days.
2. **🔴 Gather 2024 tax docs for CPA** — Can't file without them. Block 30 min today.
3. **🔴 Wire rotated DeepSeek API key into OpenClaw config** — Non-Howard agents are broken.
4. **🟡 DNS cutover — sailorskills.com from Wix to Vercel** — Marketplace is deployed but not on the main domain.
5. **🟡 Order business cards with QR code** — Due Feb 28, Crew Party is March 5.

### ⚠️ At Risk
- **2024 personal tax return** — ~10 months overdue, ~$12K with penalties, NO CPA hired yet
- **2025 S-Corp return** — Due March 15, NO CPA hired yet
- **AI costs** — ~$1,600/mo projected vs $200/mo target (8x over)
- **12 agents operational** — Non-Howard agents broken (DeepSeek key expired)

### 📅 This Week
- **Feb 28:** Business cards ordered
- **Mar 1:** SailorSkills Pro launch target
- **Mar 4:** Elevator pitch practiced
- **Mar 5:** Latitude 38 Crew Party launch event

## 💡 TODAY'S PITCH

**Ride the Greg Isenberg wave.** Yesterday he dropped "How I Use Obsidian + Claude Code to Run My Life" — Internet Vin demos slash commands that turn Obsidian into an AI thinking partner. Brian's OpenClaw setup is generations ahead of what's shown.

- **The move:** Record a response — screenshots of Dawn Patrol on Kindle, Telegram agents, cron jobs, research briefs
- **Why now:** Episode will drive massive interest. Brian's setup IS the next level. First-mover content gets algorithmic favor.
- **Effort:** Low — 1-2 hours, screenshots already exist
- **Next step:** Take 3-4 screenshots today. Draft a Twitter thread tonight. Post tomorrow while it's trending.
- **Pillar:** 💡 Building the Future (content, brand, inbound)

## ⚡ POWER CHECK

Today's focus items and the Powers they build:

- **Call CPA / Tax docs** → 💰 *Enables Investment* — Can't build Power without financial runway. Filing clears the path.
- **DeepSeek API key** → 🧠 *Cornered Resource* — Restoring the full AI team widens the capability moat.
- **DNS cutover** → ⚙️ *Process Power* + 🌐 *Network Economies* — Getting marketplace on the real domain is step one to organic traffic flywheel.
- **Business cards / Crew Party prep** → 🌐 *Network Economies* + ⚓ *Switching Costs* — Face-to-face at Crew Party builds the relationships that compound.
- **Greg Isenberg content** → 🧠 *Cornered Resource* (brand as practitioner, not guru)

---

*No boats today. Sprint meetings + CPA call + trail run + Dojo. Good day to clear the tax blocker that's been hanging over everything.*
