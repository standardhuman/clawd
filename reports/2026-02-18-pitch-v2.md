# ☀️ Morning Pitch — Wednesday, February 18, 2026

## The Idea
Test a pay-for-performance pricing model where SailorSkills only charges clients when measurable value is delivered — specifically, when fuel savings from clean hulls exceed cleaning costs.

## Why Now
The "SaaS Crash of 2026" research shows customers are hyper-sensitive to tool costs and skeptical of empty promises. Meanwhile, the arXiv hull-fouling paper gives us peer-reviewed data: optimized cleaning reduces fuel consumption by up to 5%. Combine these two insights, and you get a killer offer: "We only get paid when you save money." This eliminates buyer risk entirely and positions SailorSkills as the only service that puts its money where its mouth is.

## What It Looks Like
- **Pilot with 5-10 existing clients** who have consistent fuel usage data (liveaboards or frequent cruisers)
- **Baseline measurement:** Track 30 days of normal fuel consumption before starting performance pricing
- **Performance metric:** Client pays full subscription fee only if their monthly fuel bill drops by more than the cleaning cost. If savings are less, they pay proportionally less (or nothing if no savings)
- **Simple dashboard:** Show clients real-time fuel savings vs. cleaning costs
- **Marketing angle:** "SailorSkills Performance Pricing — We Succeed When You Save"

## Effort vs Impact
- **Effort:** Medium — requires tracking fuel data, some contract adjustments, and careful client selection for the pilot
- **Impact:** High — could become your primary differentiator, dramatically increase conversion rates, and build unbeatable client loyalty. Also perfectly aligns with your values of authenticity and serving real people.

## Recommended Next Step
Identify 3 clients with good fuel tracking habits (liveaboards are ideal) and propose the pilot to them this week. Start with a 3-month trial to gather enough data.
