## 2. What's Needed to File the 2024 Personal Return

### Documents Ready
- [x] Corrected income reconciliation (`~/AI/finance/taxes-2024/docs/income/2024-CORRECTED-INCOME-RECONCILIATION.md`)
- [x] Zoho payment export with Stripe charge ID cross-reference
- [x] Stripe balance summary and transaction records

### Still Needed
- [ ] **Hire a CPA** — top candidates identified, none engaged yet
- [ ] **Download official 1099-K forms** from Stripe and Zoho portals
- [ ] **PayPal fee records** (28 transactions, ~$4,463 — fees unknown)
- [ ] **Wix fee records** ($1,346 in payments — fees unknown)
- [ ] **Physical anode inventory count** for accurate COGS
- [ ] **Any W-2s or other income** outside SailorSkills for 2024
- [ ] **Standard deductions vs. itemized** — CPA to advise
- [ ] **1099-K reconciliation statement** — CPA must explain to IRS why reported income < 1099-K totals (double-counting issue is legitimate and well-documented)

---

## 3. What's Needed for the 2025 Form 1120-S

SailorSkills LLC elected S-Corp effective **January 1, 2025**. First 1120-S covers the full 2025 calendar year.

### Key Facts
- Brian is sole shareholder and employee
- W-2 salary paid via Gusto (already running)
- ~$6,400/month revenue (~$76,800 annualized for 2025)
- No other employees in 2025 (Sarah hiring postponed)

### What the CPA Needs
- [ ] **Gusto year-end package** — W-2, 941s, payroll tax summaries for 2025
- [ ] **Full 2025 P&L** — all revenue and expenses, January–December 2025
- [ ] **Balance sheet** — assets, liabilities, equity as of 12/31/2025
- [ ] **Shareholder basis calculation** — initial basis from LLC → S-Corp conversion
- [ ] **Officer compensation documentation** — reasonable salary analysis
- [ ] **Business bank statements** — all 12 months of 2025
- [ ] **Stripe/Zoho 2025 revenue reconciliation** (same double-counting risk applies)
- [ ] **Equipment/vehicle records** if claiming depreciation
- [ ] **Health insurance premiums** paid by S-Corp (deductible on personal return)
- [ ] **S-Corp election confirmation** (Form 2553 acceptance letter from IRS)

### 1120-S Filing Produces
- **Schedule K-1** — flows to Brian's 2025 personal return (due April 15, 2026)
- S-Corp itself pays no income tax; all income/loss passes through to Brian

## 4. Timeline & Action Items

| Date | Deadline | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| **This week (Feb 16–20)** | — | **Call a CPA.** Top picks: Dimov Tax (866-681-2140), Mary Geong (510-654-4417), Chang & Associates (510-548-1962) |
| **This week** | — | Download 1099-K forms from Stripe + Zoho portals |
| **This week** | — | Pull PayPal fee records for 2024 |
| **By Feb 28** | — | CPA engaged, 2024 docs handed off, 2025 bookkeeping scope discussed |
| **ASAP** | **OVERDUE** | **2024 personal return (1040 + Schedule C)** — 10+ months late, penalties accruing |
| **Mar 15, 2026** | **HARD DEADLINE** | **Form 1120-S** (2025 S-Corp return) — $210/month penalty per shareholder if late |
| **Mar 15, 2026** | Same | Schedule K-1 issued to Brian |
| **Apr 15, 2026** | **HARD DEADLINE** | 2025 personal return (1040) — needs K-1 from 1120-S |
| **Apr 15, 2026** | Same | Q1 2026 estimated tax payment due |

### If the 1120-S Can't Be Filed by March 15
- File **Form 7004** for automatic 6-month extension (to September 15, 2026)
- This is free and avoids the $210/month late-filing penalty
- But K-1 delay means Brian's personal return also needs extension

## 5. CPA Recommendations

All three candidates were previously identified. Priority: someone who handles **both** the overdue 2024 Schedule C and the 2025 S-Corp filing.

| Firm | Phone | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Dimov Tax** | 866-681-2140 | Specializes in tax resolution — good for the overdue return + penalties |
| **Mary Geong** | 510-654-4417 | Local Berkeley CPA |
| **Chang & Associates** | 510-548-1962 | Local East Bay firm |

### When You Call, Tell Them:
1. You have an overdue 2024 personal return (sole proprietor, Schedule C, ~$67K gross)
2. You have a 2025 S-Corp return (1120-S) due March 15
3. Revenue was initially double-counted — you have a corrected reconciliation ready
4. You need 1099-K reconciliation language for the IRS
5. Ask about pricing for both returns as a package

---

## Bottom Line

Two returns need filing. One is overdue and costing money every day. The other is due in 27 days. The corrected income reconciliation is solid and well-documented — a CPA can work from it. **The single most important action is making a phone call this week.**
