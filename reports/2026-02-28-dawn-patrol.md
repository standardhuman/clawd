## 🌊 WELLBEING

Friday was a big day — 12 boats at BRK plus the Glass Slipper special clean, then Connecting with Emotion in the evening and Aqib's call. That's a full-body, full-heart day.

- **Today:** No boats. Rest day earned. Light morning flow — hip openers + thoracic spine work (15 min). Your hips and shoulders carried a lot of weight yesterday.
- **Move if you want:** Easy spin or walk. Nothing heavy. Saturday recovery sets up a strong week.
- **Dentist at 10 AM** — hydrate before you go, eat after.

## 🧭 PILLARS & FOCUS

### 🎯 Today's Top Actions
1. **🔴 Call CPA** — Dimov, Mary Geong, or Chang. March 15 is 15 days away. 2024 personal return + 2025 S-Corp election both depend on this. *This is the single most important action.*
2. **🔴 Gather 2024 tax docs for CPA** — have these ready before the call
3. **🟡 Order business cards** with QR code to Marketplace (was due yesterday)
4. **🟡 Test Build 42** on device — verify follow-up tasks UI
5. **🟡 Wire PPV weekly review into Howard cron**

### ⚠️ At Risk
- **2024 tax return** — still no CPA engaged, 15 days to March 15 deadline
- **2025 S-Corp election** — also March 15, depends on CPA
- **AI costs 8x over target** — $200/month goal, currently way over. DeepSeek key still expired.
- **All 12 agents operational** — needs API key wiring

### 📅 This Week
- March 1 (Sun): No boats scheduled
- March 2 (Mon): Check Notion for Monday boats
- **March 15: TAX DEADLINE** — 15 days

## 💡 TODAY'S PITCH

**Open-Source Your AGENTS.md Playbook**

Max Woolf — known ML skeptic — just published his conversion story. His key insight: AGENTS.md is the differentiator. Meanwhile, Anthropic is giving free Claude Max ($200/mo) to OSS maintainers with 5K+ GitHub stars.

- **The move:** Publish `claw-playbook` repo — your 13-agent AGENTS.md templates, skill patterns, cron recipes
- **Why now:** Max's viral post validated the approach. Anthropic's OSS program means free credits (addresses your AI cost problem directly)
- **Next step:** 1 hour today extracting patterns into a clean repo. Saturday = no boats = creative time.
- **Pillars:** AI Team + Building the Future + Financial Health
