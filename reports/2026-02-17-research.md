### Data-Driven Hull-Fouling Cleaning Schedule Optimization
- **Source:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11248
- **Summary:** New paper (Feb 11) presents an optimization framework that determines vessel cleaning schedules dynamically based on real-world voyage data. Over a four-year period, fuel consumption was reduced by up to 5% compared to fixed-time cleaning policies, even accounting for costs of additional cleaning events.
- **Relevance:** Direct validation of SailorSkills' subscription model premise — proactive, data-informed hull cleaning delivers measurable ROI. This research could be cited in sales materials and used to refine cleaning interval recommendations.

### Shipping Industry Maintains Green Investments Despite Carbon Price Delay
- **Source:** https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/global-shipping-industry-sticks-with-green-investments-despite-carbon-price-2026-02-12/
- **Summary:** Despite a one-year postponement of IMO carbon pricing, global shipping firms are continuing to invest billions in dual-fuel vessels and alternative fuels. Industry executives say the delay won't change long-term commitments.
- **Relevance:** Signals that marine sustainability spending remains strong. Hull cleaning as a fuel-efficiency measure fits this trend — operators will continue valuing services that reduce carbon footprint.

### Latitude 38 Spring Crew Party — March 5 at Golden Gate Yacht Club
- **Source:** https://www.latitude38.com/lectronic/come-latitude-38-spring-crew-party-march-5/
- **Summary:** Latitude 38 is hosting its 2026 Spring Crew List Party on March 5, 6–9 PM at Golden Gate Yacht Club. Major Bay Area sailing community networking event.
- **Relevance:** Potential networking opportunity for SailorSkills. Boat owners and racing crews in one room — ideal for brand awareness or informal market research.

## 🤖 AI & Technology

### OpenClaw Founder Joins OpenAI; Project Moving to Open-Source Foundation
- **Source:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenClaw (via multiple sources)
- **Summary:** On February 14, OpenClaw creator Steinberger announced he's joining OpenAI and the project will transition to an open-source foundation. Recent updates include `openclaw logs --local-time` (v2026.2.12) and a Google Places skill consolidation.
- **Relevance:** Critical for the organization — need to monitor governance transition, potential roadmap changes, and community stability. May want to evaluate contingency options or increase community involvement.

### Google Ships WebMCP in Chrome Early Preview
- **Source:** https://venturebeat.com/infrastructure/google-chrome-ships-webmcp-in-early-preview-turning-every-website-into-a
- **Summary:** Google Chrome now includes an early preview of WebMCP (Web Model Context Protocol), a proposed standard that lets websites expose structured, callable tools to AI agents through `navigator.modelContext`. Developed with a W3C community group.
- **Relevance:** Game-changer for agent-based workflows. If SailorSkills' web platform implements WebMCP, AI agents could interact with booking, scheduling, and customer management programmatically. Worth tracking for the platform roadmap.

### GPT-5.3 Codex and Claude Opus 4.6 Released
- **Source:** https://fortune.com/2026/02/13/openais-codex-and-anthropics-claude-spark-coding-revolution-as-developers-say-theyve-abandoned-traditional-programming/
- **Summary:** OpenAI and Anthropic simultaneously released GPT-5.3 Codex and Claude Opus 4.6, representing major leaps in AI coding capabilities. Reports describe developers shipping 93,000+ lines of code in 5 days using these tools. Both models show capability for self-improvement.
- **Relevance:** Direct impact — the organization runs on Claude. Opus 4.6 improvements could accelerate SailorSkills platform development. Evaluate whether current OpenClaw config should be updated to leverage the new model.

### Anthropic–Pentagon Dispute Over Claude Military Usage
- **Source:** https://www.axios.com/2026/02/15/claude-pentagon-anthropic-contract-maduro
- **Summary:** The Pentagon is pushing AI companies (including Anthropic) to allow military use of their models for "all lawful purposes." Anthropic is pushing back, particularly regarding Claude's use in the Maduro capture operation via Palantir. Pentagon reportedly threatening to cut off Anthropic.
- **Relevance:** Signals Anthropic's continued commitment to safety guardrails — relevant context for trust in the Claude platform. Also a political risk factor if government pressure forces policy changes at Anthropic.

### Anthropic Super Bowl Ad Drives 11% User Boost
- **Source:** https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/13/anthropic-open-ai-super-bowl-ads.html
- **Summary:** Anthropic's Super Bowl ads — darkly comedic spots mocking ad-supported chatbots — drove a 6.5% site traffic increase and pushed the Claude app into the top 10. Took a direct swing at OpenAI's decision to bring ads to ChatGPT.
- **Relevance:** Anthropic gaining mainstream visibility strengthens the Claude ecosystem the organization depends on. More users = more investment = better models.

### Simon Willison: Rodney + Claude Code for Desktop
- **Source:** https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/16/rodney-claude-code/
- **Summary:** Simon Willison demonstrates using his new tool "Rodney" (CLI browser automation) with Claude Code's desktop app, allowing coding agents to take and view screenshots of their work in real-time. Designed so agents can visually verify UI changes during development.
- **Relevance:** Practical pattern for agent-assisted development. Rodney's approach to agent-friendly CLI tools (self-documenting --help) is a useful design principle for any tools built for the SailorSkills platform.
