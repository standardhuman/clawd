## The Idea
Build a Bay Area Marine Services Directory this weekend — a niche directory site that doubles as SailorSkills' top-of-funnel marketing engine.

## Why Now
Two independent builders just validated the exact same playbook: Frey Chu built a niche directory in 4 days for under $250 using Claude Code + web scrapers, and Piotr Kulpinski hit $13k/mo from his directory + boilerplate combo. The economics work because AI compresses what used to take 2,000+ hours of data collection into a weekend. Bay Area boat owners currently find service providers through marina bulletin boards, word of mouth, and scattered Yelp listings. There's no curated, searchable hub — you'd be first.

## What It Looks Like
- **Scrape and enrich data** on hull cleaners, divers, riggers, sailmakers, marine electronics installers, and bottom painters across SF Bay marinas using Frey's 7-step process (Outscraper → Claude Code → Crawl4AI → enrich)
- **Launch on a $199 Dirstarter boilerplate** or build from scratch with Claude Code — either way, Jacques can handle it
- **Seed SailorSkills as a featured provider** with reviews, pricing, and service area map — instant credibility boost
- **Monetize later** via featured listings ($50-100/mo per vendor) and lead-gen referral fees from other service providers
- **SEO play:** "hull cleaning San Francisco," "boat bottom painting Bay Area" — these are low-competition, high-intent searches that currently return garbage results

## Effort vs Impact
- **Effort:** Low-Medium — one weekend build with Jacques, ongoing maintenance is minimal (AI keeps listings fresh)
- **Impact:** High — creates a marketing asset that generates inbound leads for SailorSkills while building a standalone revenue stream. Every vendor who pays for a featured listing is also validating your platform play.

## Recommended Next Step
Have Jacques spin up the directory scaffold today using Dirstarter or a fresh Vite project. Brian spends 30 minutes tonight listing the 15-20 marine service providers he already knows personally — that's your seed data, and your industry knowledge is the moat no scraper can replicate.
