# ☀️ Morning Pitch — Saturday, February 28, 2026

## The Idea
Publish a shareable AGENTS.md template + guide on the SailorSkills blog — "How I Run a 92-Boat Business with 13 AI Agents" — and open-source it to qualify for Anthropic's free Claude Max for OSS maintainers.

## Why Now
Two signals converged overnight: (1) Max Woolf — a well-known ML skeptic — just published his conversion story where AGENTS.md was the key differentiator, calling it "the configuration layer IS the product." His post is spreading through Simon Willison's audience. (2) Anthropic launched free Claude Max 20x ($200/month value) for OSS maintainers with 5K+ GitHub stars. Brian already has the most battle-tested AGENTS.md in the wild (13 agents, Dawn Patrol, sub-agent orchestration). Publishing it as an open-source repo creates a credibility asset that feeds Marketplace discovery AND could qualify for free Claude credits — directly addressing the "AI costs 8x over target" risk flag.

## What It Looks Like
- Create `github.com/standardhuman/claw-playbook` — AGENTS.md templates, skill examples, cron patterns
- Write a companion blog post on the Marketplace site: "How I Run 92 Boats with 13 AI Agents"
- Each template naturally references SailorSkills tooling and links back to the Marketplace
- The repo becomes a lead magnet for the "Claw Setup for Teams" consulting service pitched earlier this week

## Effort vs Impact
- **Effort:** Low — the content already exists in ~/clawd/. It's packaging and publishing, not creating from scratch.
- **Impact:** High — builds Network Economies (community around templates), Cornered Resource (Brian's methodology), and directly addresses AI cost reduction via free credits.

## Recommended Next Step
Spend 1 hour today extracting the best AGENTS.md patterns into a clean repo. Saturday = no boats, perfect for creative work.

## Pillar Alignment
- 🤖 Pillar 2 (AI Agent Team) — shares and validates the methodology
- 💡 Pillar 6 (Building the Future) — content + community flywheel
- 💰 Pillar 5 (Financial Health) — free Claude credits = direct cost reduction
