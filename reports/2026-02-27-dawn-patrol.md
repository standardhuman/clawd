## 🌊 WELLBEING

Yesterday was a 10-boat day plus BuildZig client work and Notion setup for Glass Slipper — a full day of physical and mental effort. Nice work showing up for all of it.

- **Today's move:** Light morning flow — hip openers, thoracic rotations, calf stretches. You've got another 12-boat day ahead, so save your energy for the water.
- **Glass Slipper special clean** this morning before tides drop — extra effort, extra reward.
- **Tonight:** Frontier Tower "Connecting with Emotion" event at 6 PM (Pillar 7). Don't skip it — you flagged this one.
- **Tomorrow:** Dentist at Western Dental, 10 AM. Confirm the appointment (reply "C" to their text).

## 🧭 PILLARS & FOCUS

### 🎯 Today's Top Actions
1. **🔴 Call CPA** — Dimov, Mary Geong, or Chang. 2024 return overdue, 2025 S-Corp due March 15 (16 days). This has been flagged for days. Make the call.
2. **🔴 Wire DeepSeek API key** — rotated key needs to go into OpenClaw config. Quick fix, unblocks AI team.
3. **🟡 Order business cards** with QR to Marketplace — due tomorrow (Feb 28). Crew Party is 6 days out.
4. **🟡 Practice elevator pitch** for Marketplace directory — due March 4.
5. **🟡 Test Build 42 on device** — verify follow-up tasks UI before Crew Party demo.

### ⚠️ At Risk
- **2024 Tax Return** — still no CPA. Penalties accumulating.
- **2025 S-Corp Return** — March 15 deadline, 16 days. Cannot file without CPA.
- **AI costs 8x over target** — $200/mo goal vs actual spend. DeepSeek key expired makes this worse.
- **DNS cutover** (sailorskills.com Wix → Vercel) — needs to happen before Crew Party.

### 📅 This Week
- **Today:** 12 boats + Glass Slipper + Connecting with Emotion (6 PM)
- **Tomorrow (Sat):** Dentist 10 AM, no boats scheduled
- **March 1 (Sun):** —
- **March 4 (Tue):** Elevator pitch ready
- **March 5 (Thu):** 🎉 Latitude 38 Crew Party launch event

## 💡 TODAY'S PITCH

### Documentation as Distribution — Make Claude Recommend SailorSkills

**The Idea:** Turn "What Claude Code Chooses" research into a content strategy. Write definitive marine service guides on the Marketplace so AI assistants recommend sailorskills.com.

**Why Now:** Amplifying.ai proved AI agents recommend the best-documented tools (Stripe 91%, Tailwind 90%). If SailorSkills publishes authoritative marine service content, it becomes what AI recommends. Training data = the new SEO. Crew Party is 6 days out — content should be live.

**Next Step:** Record a 5-minute voice memo: "What every boat owner should know about hull cleaning in Berkeley Marina." Howard turns it into a published guide page.

**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** High
**Powers:** 🧠 Cornered Resource + 🌐 Network Economies + ⚙️ Process Power
