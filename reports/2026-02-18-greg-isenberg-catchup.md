## Episode 1: Claude Code built me a $273/Day online directory

**Title:** Claude Code built me a $273/Day online directory  
**Date:** 2026-02-16  
**Guest:** Frey Chu (Directory specialist)

### Summary
Frey Chu demonstrates building a luxury restroom trailer directory in 4 days for under $250 using Claude Code. The process involved scraping 71,000 listings, cleaning data with Claude Code, using Crawl4AI for website verification, and enriching data with inventory, images, amenities, and service areas. The directory now generates $273/day.

### Top Business Ideas
1. **Niche directories for high-ticket local services**: Focus on industries where decisions have significant consequences (senior living, legal services, healthcare, financial advisors). These directories help users save time, save money, or make money.
2. **Price transparency platforms**: Create directories for opaque industries where price information is difficult to obtain but highly valuable to users.
3. **Hyper-niche directories**: Instead of broad categories, target specific niches like "senior living homes for people with dementia" (1,000+ monthly searches) or "ADA-compliant bathrooms."
4. **Public data directories**: Leverage public databases like data.gov to create directories (e.g., tap water quality directory that reached 40,000 monthly visitors with zero backlinks).

### Methods & Tools Mentioned
- **Claude Code**: For data cleaning and processing
- **Outscraper**: For scraping data from Google Maps ($100 for 71,000 listings)
- **Crawl4AI**: Free open-source web crawler for website verification
- **Claude Vision API**: For image verification and selection ($30 for 700 listings)

The last 10 episodes of Greg Isenberg's Startup Ideas Podcast reveal a clear pattern: **AI tools have moved from novelty to utility, with specialized workflows creating real business value.** For Brian, the biggest opportunities lie in applying these proven patterns to the marine services industry where he has domain expertise.

The key insight is **not just using AI, but systematizing AI** through workflows, skills, and multi-agent systems. Brian's existing assets—SailorSkills client base, marine industry knowledge, and OpenClaw team—position him perfectly to execute on these opportunities.

**Priority Recommendation:** Start with the marine services directory (Episode 1 workflow) as it combines directory building (learn Claude Code, SEO, lead generation) with immediate application to Brian's domain. This creates both a learning platform and potential revenue stream while building data assets that could become a long-term moat.

**Final Note:** While we only captured 9 of 10 episodes due to RSS feed limitations, the patterns are clear and actionable. The consistent theme across all episodes is that **AI success comes from specialization, systematization, and domain expertise**—all areas where Brian has significant advantages.
