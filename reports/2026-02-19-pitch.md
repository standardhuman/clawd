# ☀️ Morning Pitch — Thursday, February 19, 2026

## The Idea
Start selling OpenClaw automation gigs on Upwork this week — you're already running the infrastructure, now package it as a service.

## Why Now
Greg Isenberg just featured a founder (Nick Vasilescu) who's making real money deploying OpenClaw automations for business clients via Upwork. The playbook is proven: find RPA/automation jobs, fulfill them with OpenClaw + Claude Code, charge consulting rates ($100-200/hr). You're not learning a new tool — you're literally living inside OpenClaw every day with Howard, Jacques, and the crew. That's an unfair advantage over 99% of people bidding on these gigs. And a16z is calling verticalized AI agents "the new SaaS" — this is the wave, and you're already surfing it.

## What It Looks Like
- **Post 3-5 Upwork proposals this week** targeting automation/RPA jobs — data scraping, report generation, workflow automation, content pipelines
- **Price at $150-200/hr** — you're not competing on cost, you're competing on "I'll build this in 2 hours instead of 2 weeks"
- **Fulfill using your existing OpenClaw setup** — sub-agents handle the parallelization, skills handle the workflows
- **Target verticals you understand**: marine services, small service businesses, field operations — your domain knowledge + AI tooling = moat
- **Cap it at 5-10 hrs/week** — this is side revenue that doesn't compete with diving or platform dev

## Effort vs Impact
- **Effort:** Low — you already have the infrastructure; it's just writing proposals and delivering
- **Impact:** Medium-High — even 5 billable hours/week at $150/hr adds $3,000/month revenue with zero infrastructure cost, and every gig teaches you patterns you can productize later

## Recommended Next Step
Create an Upwork profile today focused on "AI automation specialist." Have Howard draft 3 proposal templates targeting common automation requests. Bid on your first gig by Friday.
