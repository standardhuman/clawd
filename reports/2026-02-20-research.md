# Daily Research Brief — Friday, February 20, 2026

## 🔑 Top 3 Opportunities
1. **AI-coded niche directories are a proven $8k-$13k/mo business** — Two independent data points converge: Greg Isenberg's latest guest built a luxury restroom trailer directory in 4 days for $250, and Piotr Kulpinski hit $13k/mo from an open-source directory + boilerplate combo. The playbook is clear: scrape data → enrich with AI → monetize via ads/listings/lead-gen. Brian could build a Bay Area marine services directory in a weekend.
2. **Use your agency/service business as a product testing ground** — Topliner (AI for executive search) hit $10k+/mo by building their product inside a partner agency first. The pattern: service business = captive test market + distribution channel. SailorSkills IS the testing ground for any marine services tech product.
3. **Gemini 3.1 Pro drops at half the price of Opus 4.6 with similar benchmarks** — Google's latest model costs $2/$12 per million tokens vs Opus 4.6's $5/$25. For cost-sensitive sub-agent work (research, data enrichment, content generation), this could cut API costs 50%+.

## 💡 AI Business Opportunities

### AI-Coded Niche Directories ($273/day to $13k/mo)
- **Source:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_wbc5ND79o (Greg Isenberg x Frey Chu, Feb 16) + https://www.indiehackers.com/post/tech/doubling-down-on-directories-to-hit-13k-mo-2KasH9NLK3ehlTL9GeGO
- **Idea:** Two independent success stories validate the same model. Frey Chu built a luxury restroom trailer directory in 4 days for <$250 using Claude Code + Outscraper + Crawl4AI — a process that would've taken 2,000+ hours manually. Separately, Piotr Kulpinski hit $13k/mo with OpenAlternative (open-source directory, $6.5k/mo from ads/sponsors) + Dirstarter (Next.js directory boilerplate, $5k/mo in one-time sales). Frey's 7-step process: scrape raw data → clean with Claude Code → verify with Crawl4AI → enrich inventory → scrape/verify images with Claude Vision → extract amenities/features → map service areas.
- **Why now:** AI dramatically compresses the data collection and enrichment work that made directories expensive to build. The "data moat" that used to require teams of humans can now be built by one person in days.
- **Effort to test:** Low — A "Bay Area Marine Services Directory" (hull cleaners, divers, riggers, sailmakers) could be built in a long weekend using Frey's exact playbook. Monetize via featured listings from vendors + lead-gen fees.

### Agency-First Product Development (Topliner Pattern)
- **Source:** https://www.indiehackers.com/post/tech/hitting-10k-mo-by-using-an-agency-as-both-testing-ground-and-distribution-FF8kooe4FWGH9sHjVrT3
- **Idea:** Arsen Ibragimov built Topliner, an AI operating system for executive search agencies, to $10k+/mo with zero ad spend. The key: his cofounder ran an agency (The Big Search), so they had a captive customer from day one. They reduced 6 weeks of candidate research to 6 hours. Critical design choice: "glass box" over "black box" — users see every AI decision with evidence, not just outputs. Zero tolerance for hallucinations in high-stakes contexts.
- **Why now:** The "agency-first" model eliminates the cold start problem. You don't need to find customers — you ARE the customer.
- **Effort to test:** Low — SailorSkills already has the agency. Any tool built for internal operations (scheduling optimization, client communication, reporting) is immediately testable with real data and real feedback.

## ⚓ SailorSkills Augmentation

### The Directory Opportunity: Bay Area Marine Services
- **Source:** Greg Isenberg x Frey Chu episode + Dirstarter success
- **Summary:** Niche directories targeting high-consideration purchases (where people compare multiple providers) are thriving. Marine services — hull cleaning, bottom painting, rigging, sailmaking, marine electronics — is a perfect fit. Boat owners in the Bay Area currently find service providers through marina bulletin boards, word of mouth, and scattered Yelp listings. A curated, AI-enriched directory with reviews, pricing transparency, and service area maps would be a category first.
- **Action:** Build a marine services directory for the SF Bay using Dirstarter ($199 boilerplate) or from scratch with Claude Code. Seed it with SailorSkills as a featured provider. Monetize via featured listings ($50-100/mo per vendor) and lead-gen referral fees. This doubles as marketing infrastructure for SailorSkills itself.

### Topliner's "Glass Box" Design = Template for SailorSkills AI
- **Source:** Topliner interview on Indie Hackers
- **Summary:** Topliner's approach to AI transparency — showing evidence for every recommendation, letting humans override at every step — is directly applicable to any AI-powered client communication SailorSkills builds. If an AI schedules a hull cleaning or recommends a service interval, the boat owner should see *why* (water temp data, fouling rate, last cleaning date).
- **Action:** When building client-facing AI features, adopt the "glass box" principle: every AI recommendation includes its reasoning and data sources. This builds trust and differentiates from generic AI chatbots.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods

### Gemini 3.1 Pro — Half-Price Alternative for Sub-Agent Work
- **Source:** https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/gemini-models/gemini-3-1-pro/ + https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/19/gemini-31-pro/
- **What it does:** Google's latest model at $2/$12 per million tokens (input/output), less than half the price of Opus 4.6 ($5/$25) with very similar benchmark scores. 1M+ token context window. Simon Willison notes it struggled on launch day with high demand (104s response to "hi"), but this should stabilize.
- **How we'd use it:** Benchmark Gemini 3.1 Pro for research sub-agent runs, data enrichment, and content generation tasks. If quality is comparable for these use cases, switching could cut API costs ~50%. Keep Opus for complex coding and architecture work.

### Anthropic Research: Agent Autonomy Is Growing Fast
- **Source:** https://www.anthropic.com/research/measuring-agent-autonomy
- **What it does:** Anthropic analyzed millions of real-world interactions. Key findings: (1) The longest Claude Code sessions nearly doubled from 25 to 45 minutes between Oct 2025 and Jan 2026. (2) Experienced users move to full auto-approve — from ~20% of sessions for new users to 40%+ for experienced ones. (3) Claude Code stops to ask for clarification more than twice as often as humans interrupt it. (4) ~50% of agentic API usage is software engineering, with emerging usage in healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity.
- **How we'd use it:** This validates the trajectory Brian is already on — giving agents more autonomy over time. The "experienced users auto-approve more but interrupt more strategically" pattern is exactly how OpenClaw should be configured: trust the agent for routine work, intervene on judgment calls.

### Consistency Diffusion Language Models (CDLM) — 14x Faster Inference
- **Source:** https://www.together.ai/blog/consistency-diffusion-language-models
- **What it does:** Together AI's research on a new inference approach: instead of generating tokens one at a time (autoregressive), CDLM refines multiple tokens simultaneously using diffusion. Achieves up to 14x faster inference without quality loss. Uses block-wise causal masking to enable KV caching (previously impossible with diffusion models).
- **How we'd use it:** This is research-stage but signals where inference is heading. If commercialized, it could dramatically reduce latency and cost for AI-powered features. Worth monitoring Together AI's productization timeline.

### Micasa — Terminal-Based Home Tracking (Show HN, 523 points)
- **Source:** https://micasa.dev / https://github.com/cpcloud/micasa
- **What it does:** Terminal UI for tracking everything about your home — maintenance schedules, projects, incidents, appliances, vendors, quotes, documents. Single SQLite file, no cloud, no account. Vim-style modal keyboard navigation inspired by VisiData.
- **How we'd use it:** The design pattern (SQLite + terminal UI for asset/maintenance tracking) maps directly to boat maintenance tracking. A "MiBarco" variant for vessel owners could track bottom cleanings, engine hours, rigging inspections, haul-outs, and warranty dates. The single-file, no-cloud approach appeals to privacy-conscious boat owners.
