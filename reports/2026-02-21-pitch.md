# ☀️ Morning Pitch — Saturday, February 21, 2026

## The Idea
Build a voice-first dive report tool — divers narrate findings underwater or right after surfacing, and AI turns it into a polished client report with zero typing.

## Why Now
Juno just proved that "ambient audio → structured data" is a product category people will pay $1,299 for. The same pipeline — always-on capture, local transcription, AI structuring — maps perfectly to hull cleaning operations. Right now, your divers surface, try to remember what they saw, and manually write or dictate reports. That's friction that costs you time and loses detail. Whisper + Claude can transcribe and structure a narration into a client-ready report in under 30 seconds. And with ggml joining Hugging Face, local inference is about to get dramatically simpler — meaning this could run entirely on a phone with no API costs.

## What It Looks Like
- **Simple mobile app or shortcut**: diver taps record, narrates findings ("Port side below waterline — light slime, cleaned easily. Starboard — moderate barnacle growth near through-hull, scraped clean. Zinc at 40%, recommend replacement next visit.")
- **AI structures the narration** into your existing report format: condition summary, work performed, photos tagged, follow-up items flagged
- **Auto-generates client email** with the formatted report — one tap to send
- **Flags maintenance items** (low zinc, damaged antifouling, growth patterns) and creates follow-up tasks in your scheduling system
- **V1 is dead simple**: a Siri Shortcut or minimal web app that sends audio to Whisper → Claude → formatted markdown/email. No hardware needed.

## Effort vs Impact
- **Effort:** Low — Jacques could prototype this in a day using Whisper API + Claude. A Siri Shortcut version could work by this afternoon.
- **Impact:** High — saves 10-15 minutes per dive report (across 92 clients, that's 15-23 hours/month recovered), improves report quality and consistency, and becomes a differentiator no other hull cleaner offers. Clients get better documentation; you get time back.

## Recommended Next Step
Have Jacques build a Siri Shortcut prototype today: tap to record → Whisper transcription → Claude formatting → output a client report template. Test it on your next 3 dives Monday and see if the output quality is worth productizing.
