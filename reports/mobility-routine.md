# 15-20 Minute Mobility Routine for Multi-Sport Athletes

## Overview
A research-based mobility routine designed for athletes who lift weights 3x/week, run, and mountain bike. This 15-20 minute routine targets specific tightness patterns from all three activities and can be performed 3x/week.

**Based on evidence from:**
- American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for stretching frequency and duration
- Physical therapy recommendations from Doctor of Physical Therapy Bo Babenko (BarBend)
- Harvard Health stretching recommendations
- Research on optimal stretch hold times (30-60 seconds per muscle group)

## Target Areas & Rationale

### From Cycling:
- **Hip flexors**: Tight from prolonged seated position
- **Hamstrings**: Shortened from bent-leg position
- **Thoracic spine**: Rounded forward posture on bike

### From Running:
- **Calves & ankles**: Repetitive impact and propulsion
- **IT band**: Lateral stability demands
- **Hip external rotators**: Single-leg stability

### From Weightlifting:
- **Shoulders**: Overhead pressing and pulling movements
- **Lower back**: Deadlifts and squats
- **Hip internal rotation**: Squat depth limitations

## The Routine (15-20 Minutes)

### Part 1: Breathing & Activation (2-3 minutes)
**Crocodile Breathing** (Source: BarBend, DPT Bo Babenko)
- Lie face-down with arms crossed, forehead on hands
- Exhale fully, then inhale deeply for 5 seconds
- Focus on expanding lower back toward ceiling
- **Duration**: 3 minutes (sets up nervous system for mobility work)

### Part 2: Lower Body Mobility (8-10 minutes)

#### 1. 90/90 Hip Rotations (2 minutes)
- Sit with both knees bent at 90 degrees, one forward, one back
- Slowly switch positions using hip muscles only
- **Hold**: 30 seconds per side × 2 rounds
- **Targets**: Hip internal/external rotation (cycling, squat depth)

#### 2. Cossack Squats (2 minutes)
- Wide stance, toes slightly out
- Shift weight side-to-side while keeping opposite leg straight
- **Reps**: 6 per side × 2 rounds
- **Targets**: Adductors, ankle mobility (running, mountain biking)

#### 3. Sciatic Nerve Floss (2 minutes)
- Staggered stance, forward foot heel-only contact
- Hinge forward with flat back while sweeping arms forward
- **Reps**: 5 per side × 2 rounds
- **Targets**: Hamstrings, neural mobility (often mistaken for tight hamstrings)

#### 4. Banded Hip Mobilization (2 minutes) *if bands available*
- Band around squat rack at knee height, loop in groin
- Kneel with banded knee down, opposite foot forward
- Allow band to pull hip into extension
- **Hold**: 30 seconds per side × 2 rounds
- **Targets**: Hip flexors (cycling, sitting)

### Part 3: Upper Body & Spine (5-7 minutes)

#### 1. Thoracic Foam Rolling (2 minutes)
- Roller under upper/mid back
- Reach arms overhead to increase stretch
- **Duration**: 30 seconds × 3-4 positions
- **Targets**: Thoracic spine (cycling posture, overhead lifts)

#### 2. Shoulder CARs (Controlled Articular Rotations) (2 minutes)
- Half-kneeling next to wall
- Arm traces arc up wall, behind head, down other side
- **Reps**: 5 per side × 2 rounds
- **Targets**: Shoulder mobility (weightlifting, mountain biking)

#### 3. Dead Hang (1-2 minutes)
- Overhand grip on pull-up bar
- Relax shoulders, allow gentle traction
- **Hold**: 30 seconds × 2-3 rounds
- **Targets**: Shoulders, decompresses spine (counteracts lifting compression)

### Part 4: Integrated Stretches (Optional if time permits)

#### 1. Kang Squat (1 minute)
- Barbell on back, hinge then sink into deep squat
- **Reps**: 5 × 1 round
- **Targets**: Posterior chain, breathing in bottom position

#### 2. World's Greatest Stretch (1 minute per side)
- Lunge with opposite elbow to instep, then rotate torso upward
- **Hold**: 30 seconds per side
- **Targets**: Hip flexors, thoracic rotation, hamstrings

## Progressive Overload & Advancement

### Beginner (Weeks 1-4):
- Focus on form and breathing
- Hold times: 20-30 seconds
- 2 rounds of each exercise
- Skip advanced variations

### Intermediate (Weeks 5-8):
- Increase hold times to 30-45 seconds
- 3 rounds of each exercise
- Add light resistance (bands, light kettlebells)
- Include Kang Squats with PVC pipe

### Advanced (Weeks 9+):
- Hold times: 45-60 seconds
- 3-4 rounds
- Add loaded carries (kettlebell march + reverse lunge)
- Include kettlebell windmills for oblique mobility

## Frequency & Timing Recommendations

### Optimal Schedule:
- **3x/week** on non-consecutive days
- **Best times**: After workouts (when muscles are warm) or as standalone sessions
- **Avoid**: Cold stretching first thing in morning

### According to ACSM/Harvard Health:
- Minimum 2-3x/week for all major muscle groups
- 60 seconds total per muscle group (can be split into multiple holds)
- Consistency > intensity

## Evidence-Based Principles

1. **Hold Times**: 30-60 seconds per stretch is optimal for flexibility gains (ACSM, Harvard Health)
2. **Frequency**: 2-3x/week shows measurable improvements (systematic review evidence)
3. **Breathing**: Deep diaphragmatic breathing reduces neural tension and improves stretch tolerance
4. **Progression**: Like strength training, mobility requires progressive overload (increased time, depth, or load)

## Equipment Needed
- Exercise mat (optional)
- Foam roller
- Resistance band (light-medium)
- Pull-up bar or sturdy overhead structure
- Kettlebell or dumbbell (5-15 lbs for progression)

## Safety Notes
- Never stretch to pain (mild discomfort is okay)
- Breathe continuously through stretches
- Consult physical therapist if experiencing nerve pain (tingling, numbness)
- Warm up with light cardio (5 min walk/jog) if doing standalone session

## Customization Tips

**If short on time (10 minutes):**
1. Crocodile Breathing (2 min)
2. 90/90 Hip Rotations (2 min)
3. Thoracic Foam Rolling (2 min)
4. Dead Hang (2 min)
5. Cossack Squats (2 min)

**If focusing on a specific activity:**
- **Pre-ride**: Emphasize hip flexors, thoracic spine
- **Pre-run**: Emphasize calves, IT band, hip external rotation
- **Pre-lift**: Emphasize shoulders, thoracic spine, hip internal rotation

**Record progress:**
- Note range of motion improvements
- Track discomfort reduction in specific positions
- Monitor performance improvements in primary sports
