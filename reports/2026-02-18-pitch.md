# ☀️ Morning Pitch — Wednesday, February 18, 2026

## The Idea
Switch your AI team to Claude Sonnet 4.6 and reinvest the savings into more agent capacity for platform development.

## Why Now
Anthropic dropped Sonnet 4.6 yesterday — Opus-level performance at Sonnet pricing ($3/$15 per M tokens), with a 1M context window. You're currently running Opus 4. That means you can get the same quality work from Howard, Jacques, and the crew at roughly 40% lower cost, or — the better move — keep the same budget and let your agents do more. With the SailorSkills platform in active development and the Latitude 38 event in two weeks needing prep, this is a force multiplier that costs you nothing.

## What It Looks Like
- **Swap the default model** in OpenClaw config from Opus 4 to Sonnet 4.6 for most agent sessions
- Keep Opus for complex architecture decisions or deep reasoning tasks (Howard's strategic work)
- The 1M context window means Jacques can work with entire codebases in a single session — no more chunking
- Estimated savings: if you're spending ~$100/month on model costs, you either pocket $40 or get 60% more agent throughput
- Test for a week on non-critical tasks, then roll out fully if quality holds

## Effort vs Impact
- **Effort:** Low — one config change, 10 minutes to test
- **Impact:** Medium-High — either real dollar savings or significantly more dev capacity at the same spend, right when platform work is ramping up

## Recommended Next Step
Ask Howard to benchmark Sonnet 4.6 against your current model on a few recent Jacques coding tasks today. If quality holds, flip the default by end of day.
