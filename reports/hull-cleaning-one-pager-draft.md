# The Math Behind Clean Hulls
## How Data-Driven Cleaning Saves Fuel & Money for Recreational Boaters

---

### 🎯 The Bottom Line
**Clean hulls save up to 5% on fuel costs** — even after paying for cleaning.

That's not marketing hype. It's peer-reviewed science from the University of Southampton, published February 2026.

### 📊 The Research
A team at the University of Southampton analyzed real-world sensor data from ten vessels over four years. Their data-driven optimization model found:

> **"Over a four-year period, fuel consumption can be reduced by up to 5%, even when accounting for the costs of one or two additional cleaning events."**

### ⛵ What This Means for Your 30-50ft Boat

**Typical SF Bay Fuel Costs:**
- **30ft sailboat:** ~$150-250/month in season
- **40ft powerboat:** ~$400-800/month in season  
- **50ft yacht:** ~$800-1,500/month in season

**5% Savings = Real Money:**
- **30ft boat:** $90-150/year saved
- **40ft boat:** $240-480/year saved  
- **50ft boat:** $480-900/year saved

*And that's just fuel. Clean hulls also mean:*
- Better handling & performance
- Reduced engine wear
- Lower emissions (good for the Bay)
- Higher resale value

### ⚖️ The Choice: Proactive vs. Reactive

| **Subscription Cleaning** | **Reactive Haul-Outs** |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Cost:** Predictable monthly fee | **Cost:** $1,500-3,000+ per haul-out |
| **Schedule:** Regular, optimized timing | **Schedule:** Emergency, disruptive |
| **Fuel:** Consistent 3-5% savings | **Fuel:** Wasting 5-15% between cleanings |
| **Downtime:** None (in-water service) | **Downtime:** Days to weeks off the water |
| **Hull:** Protected year-round | **Hull:** Damage accumulates between cleanings |

### 🧮 The SailorSkills Advantage

We apply the same data-driven approach from the research to recreational boats:

1. **Smart Scheduling:** We optimize cleaning timing based on your boat's usage patterns
2. **Cost Transparency:** One predictable monthly fee covers all cleaning
3. **Bay Expertise:** We know SF Bay's unique fouling conditions
4. **Environmental Focus:** Clean hulls = less fuel = cleaner Bay
