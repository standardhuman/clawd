# Daily Research Brief — Friday, February 27, 2026

## 🔑 Top 3 Opportunities
1. **"What Claude Code Chooses" research (378 pts on HN) reveals the invisible hand shaping every vibe-coded app — and it's a content marketing goldmine** — Claude Code picks Tailwind 90%, shadcn/ui 90%, Vercel 100% for JS, Railway 82% for Python, and builds custom solutions in 12/20 categories. If you write tutorials about your framework, Claude will recommend it to every developer on the planet. This is the new SEO.
2. **Greg Isenberg tests Perplexity Computer live — a $200/month persistent agent that does cold outreach, competitive intel, and VC research** — Published today. Perplexity Computer runs parallel sub-agents across the open web, connects to Gmail/Slack/HubSpot, and sends real emails. Greg says "the $200/month pays for itself with one closed deal." This is the clearest competitor to OpenClaw for non-technical founders.
3. **Anthropic's Dario Amodei publicly draws red lines on military AI (1,669 pts, 858 comments) — the most important AI governance moment of the year** — Anthropic refuses mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons, even as it's deeply embedded in DoW/IC operations. Google DeepMind employees immediately followed with their own letter. This reshapes the competitive landscape and validates Anthropic as the "trustworthy AI" choice.

## 💡 AI Business Opportunities

### "What Claude Code Chooses" — The New Developer Marketing Playbook
- **Source:** https://amplifying.ai/research/claude-code-picks (378 pts on HN)
- **Idea:** Amplifying.ai ran 2,430 open-ended prompts against Claude Code across 3 models and 4 project types. The findings are explosive: Claude builds custom solutions (DIY) more than it recommends any single tool, but when it picks, it picks decisively — GitHub Actions 94%, Stripe 91%, shadcn/ui 90%. The "recency gradient" shows newer models prefer newer tools (Prisma 79% → 0%, Drizzle 21% → 100% across model generations). AWS/GCP/Azure got ZERO primary deployment picks. The HN discussion crystalizes it: "Write enough blog posts about your framework and Claude will recommend it to every developer on the planet for free."
- **Why now:** This is the new distribution channel. If Brian builds tools or frameworks for SailorSkills (or for Claw deployment), ensuring they have good documentation and tutorials means Claude Code will recommend them. The "training data as marketing" insight is immediately actionable. Also: knowing the default stack (Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn + Zustand + Vercel) helps Brian make faster tech choices that align with what AI agents will generate.
- **Effort to test:** Low — Adopt the "Claude Code default stack" for any new project to maximize AI-assisted development speed. For SailorSkills, ensure any public documentation is tutorial-rich to influence future model training.

### Perplexity Computer — The Non-Technical Founder's OpenClaw
- **Source:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-J8RodcM_A (Greg Isenberg, published Feb 27)
- **Idea:** Greg tests Perplexity Computer ($200/month Max plan) on 5 founder use cases: (1) warm outbound at scale — finds real emails, researches prospects' recent activity, drafts personalized cold emails, sends via connected Gmail; (2) recurring competitive intelligence on autopilot; (3) investor pipeline research (50 VCs with thesis alignment); (4) podcast → content machine; (5) live market diligence (Shopify investment memo). Key differentiator from OpenClaw: it runs on Perplexity's cloud with built-in connectors (Gmail, Drive, Slack, HubSpot, Ahrefs, Reddit).
- **Why now:** This is the first major "persistent agent for business" product with mainstream distribution (Greg's audience). It validates the market Brian's in but targets a different segment — non-technical founders who want a GUI, not a CLI. The $200/month price point also anchors the market. OpenClaw's advantage: deeper customization, local data, no vendor lock-in. Perplexity's advantage: zero setup, pre-built integrations.
- **Effort to test:** Low — Brian should try the free tier and compare against his OpenClaw setup. The competitive intel and outreach workflows are directly comparable. Understanding where Perplexity Computer falls short reveals OpenClaw's positioning.

### "Vibe Coding and the Maker Movement" — The Smartest Framing of AI's Impact
- **Source:** https://read.technically.dev/p/vibe-coding-and-the-maker-movement (364 pts, 365 comments on HN)
- **Idea:** The author draws a structural parallel between vibe coding and the 2005-2015 Maker Movement. Both have salvation narratives ("master this tool, transform yourself"), both generate "crapjects" (the Maker Movement's term for useless 3D prints = vibe coding's slop), and both operate with productive slack — permission to play without shipping. Fred Turner's Stanford research frames it: the Maker Movement reinvented Puritan frontier theology for the digital age. The key insight: every hobbyist tech scene (homebrew computers, punk zines, early web, makers, now vibe coding) follows the same pattern — play with "toys" → scenius forms → real businesses emerge years later.
- **Why now:** This is the best strategic framework for understanding where vibe coding is heading. If the Maker Movement pattern holds, most vibe-coded projects will go nowhere, but the people who develop taste and craft through play will build the next generation of real businesses. Brian is already in the "developing craft" phase. The framework helps him position consulting: "I'll help you skip the crapject phase."
- **Effort to test:** N/A — strategic framing. Use this in content and client conversations.

## ⚓ SailorSkills Augmentation

### Anthropic's Military AI Red Lines — Brand Alignment for Claw Deployments
- **Source:** https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-department-of-war (1,669 pts on HN)
- **Summary:** Dario Amodei published a statement revealing Anthropic's red lines with the Department of War: no mass domestic surveillance, no fully autonomous weapons. Anthropic is already deeply embedded — first frontier AI company in classified networks, first at National Labs, first with custom models for national security. They also forewent "several hundred million dollars" by cutting off CCP-linked firms. The HN thread is overwhelmingly supportive, with an ex-Anthropic employee saying leadership would "genuinely burn at the stake" before violating their values. Google DeepMind employees published a parallel letter the same day.
- **Action:** This is the strongest validation yet for building on Anthropic/Claude. For any client conversation about AI platform choice, the contrast is now stark: Anthropic publicly sets ethical limits and walks away from revenue; others don't. Combined with yesterday's Benedict Evans analysis (OpenAI lacks PMF), Brian's Anthropic-first positioning is increasingly well-justified. Use this in any SailorSkills investor/partner materials.

### Perplexity Computer as Competitive Intel for SailorSkills
- **Source:** Greg Isenberg episode (above)
- **Summary:** The competitive intelligence monitoring workflow Greg demos — setting up daily automated reports on competitors' sponsorships, pricing changes, and product launches — is directly applicable to SailorSkills. A $200/month Perplexity Computer subscription could monitor marine service competitors, marina developments, and boating industry changes automatically.
- **Action:** Evaluate whether a Perplexity Computer subscription is worth it for automated competitive monitoring vs. Noa's nightly research runs. The answer probably depends on whether Brian wants real-time alerts (Perplexity) vs. curated daily briefs (Noa/OpenClaw).

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods

### Simon Willison's "Hoard Things You Know How to Do" — Agentic Engineering Pattern
- **Source:** https://simonwillison.net/guides/agentic-engineering-patterns/hoard-things-you-know-how-to-do/
- **What it does:** New guide entry arguing that your most valuable asset as a developer is a deep collection of working solutions to "is this possible?" questions. Simon hoards solutions across his blog, TIL blog, 1,000+ GitHub repos, and tools.simonwillison.net. The key agentic insight: these hoarded solutions become powerful inputs for coding agents. His favorite pattern: "tell an agent to build something new by combining two or more existing working examples." Example: combining Tesseract.js (OCR) + PDF.js (PDF rendering) snippets to build a browser-based PDF OCR tool.
- **How we'd use it:** Brian already does this with Obsidian + OpenClaw. The actionable addition: be more systematic about saving working code snippets as standalone examples. When Brian builds something that works (a Stripe integration, a voice pipeline, a cron job pattern), save a minimal working version as a reusable template. These become the building blocks for faster AI-assisted development. The AGENTS.md + skills architecture is already this pattern — Simon's framing just makes it more deliberate.

### Parakeet.cpp — Nvidia ASR Inference in Pure C++ with Metal
- **Source:** https://github.com/Frikallo/parakeet.cpp (36 pts on HN)
- **What it does:** Pure C++ implementation of Nvidia's Parakeet ASR models with Metal GPU acceleration on Apple Silicon. Sub-real-time inference on M-series Macs. This is the Whisper.cpp equivalent for Nvidia's newer, faster speech recognition models.
- **How we'd use it:** Combined with Moonshine (reported Feb 25), this gives two open-source STT options for local, on-device speech recognition. For SailorSkills Pro's voice logging feature, local ASR means: (1) works offline on the boat, (2) no API costs, (3) no latency. Worth benchmarking against Moonshine for accuracy and speed on Apple Silicon.

### Cardboard — Agentic Video Editor (YC W26)
- **Source:** https://www.usecardboard.com (110 pts, Launch HN)
- **What it does:** Natural language video editing — "make a 60s recap from this raw footage" or "beat-sync this to music." Client-side rendering via WebCodecs/WebGL2, no server processing. Handles multi-track timelines, shot detection, beat sync, voiceover generation, voice cloning, background removal, captions that are spatially aware of subjects. Exports to Premiere Pro/DaVinci/FCP XML.
- **How we'd use it:** Directly relevant for SailorSkills content. Brian has GoPro footage from every dive service. Cardboard could turn raw underwater footage into client-ready service documentation videos or social media content with minimal effort. "Show me the best 30 seconds of hull cleaning footage" → instant marketing content. Also relevant for Greg Isenberg's "podcast to content machine" workflow.

### Block Layoffs Signal — AI Replacing Entire Functions
- **Source:** https://twitter.com/jack/status/2027129697092731343 (672 pts, 706 comments on HN)
- **What it does:** Jack Dorsey announced layoffs at Block (Square/Cash App). The HN discussion focuses on AI replacing middle-management and coordination functions. Multiple commenters report their companies have eliminated entire QA, project management, and content teams and replaced them with AI + smaller engineering teams.
- **How we'd use it:** Market signal — the companies cutting headcount are creating a consulting opportunity. Displaced workers need to reskill, and companies that cut too aggressively will need external help when AI tools fail. "AI transition consulting" is the diplomatic framing for what's essentially the same Claw deployment service.

## 🔍 New Sources Discovered
- **Amplifying.ai** (amplifying.ai) — Research lab studying AI coding agent behavior empirically. The "What Claude Code Chooses" study is the best data on AI tool preferences. Worth tracking for future studies.
- **Technically Dev** (read.technically.dev) — Smart long-form analysis of developer culture and AI. The Maker Movement parallel is best-in-class framing.
