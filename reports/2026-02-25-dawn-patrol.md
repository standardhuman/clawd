## 🌊 WELLBEING (Rio)

Yesterday was a WFH day — sprint planning, calls, late-evening org work. No workout logged. That's two admin-heavy days in a row, so your body is ready to move.

- **Morning flow**: Hip flexor openers → thoracic spine rotations → bodyweight squats → calf raises. 10 min, wake everything up.
- **Today's move**: Get a strength session in. You've been heads-down on screens — compound lifts will reset your nervous system.
- **🔔 TMC tonight** — Wednesday circle. Protect that time. Phones off by 7pm.

## 🧭 PILLARS & FOCUS (PPV)

### 🎯 Today's Top Actions
1. **File 2025 S-Corp return** — March 15 deadline is 18 days away. CPA call still needed. ⚠️
2. **SailorSkills Pro testing** — Builds 47 & 48 dropped yesterday via TestFlight. Test them.
3. **Fix Vercel deployment** — Failed production deployment email from yesterday. Don't let it linger.
4. **Justin Joseph status report** — Review and respond (email from yesterday, marked Important)
5. **Jacob Strong status report** — Review (email from yesterday, marked Important)

### ⚠️ At Risk
- **2024 personal tax return** — ~10 months overdue, ~$12K with penalties. This needs a CPA call THIS WEEK.
- **2025 S-Corp return** — 18 days to March 15 deadline
- **AI costs** — Flagged 8x over $200/month budget last briefing
- **SailorSkills Pro March 1 launch** — 4 days out. Vercel deploy is broken.

### 📅 This Week
- **Friday**: Morgan Bailey going-away dinner (TMC — Brian Burt's email)
- **Saturday**: "Extraordinary Lover" workshop (Maya's Partiful reminder)
- **March 1 (Sunday)**: SailorSkills Pro launch target

## 💡 TODAY'S PITCH (Kai)

### Claw Setup for Teams — The Market Is Asking For It

**The Idea:** Offer paid consulting to help small teams deploy OpenClaw for their specific workflows.

**Why Now:** Yesterday's "Ask HN: Share your productive usage of OpenClaw" thread is live market research. Users describe exact workflows and willingness to pay (~$75/week for a personal Claw). One commenter: "everybody on the team said they'd be sad if we took it away." Nobody is packaging setup as a service. Pi Agent just launched standalone (320 pts HN), making infrastructure more accessible but also more confusing.

**What It Looks Like:**
- $500-$1,500 per team setup (Mac Mini + OpenClaw + custom skills)
- 3 packages: Personal ($500), Team ($1,000), Enterprise ($1,500+)
- Recurring $100/month support retainer
- Brian's credibility: "I run a 92-boat business with 12 AI agents"

**Effort:** Low — you ARE the playbook | **Impact:** High — new revenue, Cornered Resource leverage

**Next Step:** Write a 3-paragraph response in the HN thread today describing your setup. Include briancline.co link. Warm outbound to a self-selected audience.
