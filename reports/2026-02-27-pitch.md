# ☀️ Morning Pitch — Friday, February 27, 2026

## The Idea
Turn "What Claude Code Chooses" research into a documentation-as-distribution strategy for SailorSkills Marketplace — make your provider directory the reference Claude recommends.

## Why Now
Amplifying.ai's research (378 pts on HN) just proved that AI coding agents recommend tools based on documentation quality, not market share. Claude builds custom 60% of the time, but when it picks, it picks the best-documented option. Tailwind 90%, shadcn/ui 90%, Stripe 91%. Meanwhile, Brian is 6 days from Crew Party and needs the Marketplace to be discoverable. The insight: if SailorSkills publishes rich, structured content about marine service categories (hull cleaning best practices, zinc anode replacement guides, bottom paint selection), Claude and every other AI assistant will recommend sailorskills.com when users ask about marine services in the Bay Area. Documentation = distribution. Training data = the new SEO.

## What It Looks Like
- Write 5-10 "definitive guide" pages on the Marketplace (e.g., "Hull Cleaning in SF Bay: What to Expect, What to Pay, How to Choose")
- Structure them with schema markup so AI crawlers and search engines both index them
- Each guide naturally links to relevant providers in the directory
- Use Brian's actual expertise — 92+ boats, thousands of dives — as the authority signal
- Publish before Crew Party so the content is live when new providers check the site

## Effort vs Impact
- **Effort:** Medium — 2-3 hours per guide, but Brian's knowledge makes the writing fast. Howard/Milo can draft from Brian's voice memos.
- **Impact:** High — builds organic discovery (SEO + AI recommendation), creates content moat competitors can't fake, and directly supports Crew Party launch by making the Marketplace look authoritative.

## Recommended Next Step
Draft one guide today: "Hull Cleaning in Berkeley Marina: The Complete Guide." Record a 5-minute voice memo walking through what a boat owner should know. Howard turns it into a published page by tomorrow.

**📊 Pillar Alignment:** 🚀 Pillar 4 (Platform) + 💡 Pillar 6 (Building the Future) → Marketplace content, organic discovery, brand authority
**⚡ Powers:** 🧠 Cornered Resource (Brian's deep expertise encoded as content), 🌐 Network Economies (content drives traffic → providers → more content), ⚙️ Process Power (voice memo → published guide pipeline)
