## 🔑 Top 3 Opportunities
1. **CLIHub makes MCP 94% cheaper by replacing JSON Schema tool dumps with CLI `--help` — this is immediately useful for any Claw deployment and validates OpenClaw's skill architecture** — The post explicitly cites OpenClaw's `available_skills` block as the inspiration for its CLI format. Brian's setup already benefits; CLIHub could help clients reduce token costs dramatically.
2. **Claude Code Remote Control launches — and Simon Willison immediately contrasts it unfavorably to OpenClaw** — Anthropic's new feature lets you control Claude Code from your phone, but it doesn't support `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, can't run on a schedule, and breaks if the machine restarts. Simon writes: "It's interesting to then contrast this to solutions like OpenClaw." This is free competitive positioning.
3. **FDM-1: First fully general computer action model trained on 11M hours of screen recordings** — SI Inc built a foundation model that watches video (not screenshots) and takes computer actions. 50x more token-efficient than prior approaches. This is the next generation of computer-use agents — relevant for both tooling and competitive awareness.

## 💡 AI Business Opportunities

### CLIHub — Make MCP 94% Cheaper with CLI Wrappers
- **Source:** https://kanyilmaz.me/2026/02/23/cli-vs-mcp.html (197 pts on HN)
- **Idea:** MCP servers dump entire tool schemas (~15,540 tokens for 84 tools) into every conversation. CLIHub converts MCP servers into CLIs with lazy `--help` loading, reducing session start to ~300 tokens. The agent discovers tool details only when needed. The author explicitly models the approach on OpenClaw's `available_skills` block format. One command converts any MCP server to a CLI.
- **Why now:** Token cost is the #1 barrier to running Claws autonomously (as the Feb 25 "Ask HN" thread showed — $75/week for a personal Claw). A 94% reduction in tool schema overhead directly reduces operating costs. For anyone running multiple MCP servers, this is immediate savings.
- **Effort to test:** Low — `npm install clihub`, convert existing MCP servers. Worth testing with Brian's Notion and other MCP integrations.

### OpenAI's "Capability Gap" — Benedict Evans on Why ChatGPT Lacks PMF
- **Source:** https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2026/2/19/how-will-openai-compete-nkg2x (189 pts, 217 comments on HN)
- **Idea:** Benedict Evans argues that OpenAI has no durable competitive advantage: no unique technology, narrow engagement, no network effects, and no clear product-market fit. "If people are only using this a couple of times a week at most, and can't think of anything to do with it on the average day, it hasn't changed their life." OpenAI's ad project is partly about giving free users better models to deepen engagement, but Evans frames this as a sign of weakness, not strength. The head of product at an AI lab "opens email in the morning and discovers that the labs have worked something out, and your job is to turn that into a button."
- **Why now:** This analysis validates Brian's positioning on Anthropic/OpenClaw. The models are commoditizing; the value is in deployment, integration, and workflow design — exactly what consulting offers. Evans explicitly notes that companies like Google with existing distribution have the structural advantage.
- **Effort to test:** N/A — strategic context. Use this framing in any client conversation about AI platform choice.

### tldraw Moving Tests to Private Repo — AI Cloning Defense Creates a New Category
- **Source:** https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/8082 (via Simon Willison)
- **Idea:** tldraw is moving its test suite to a closed-source repo because "a comprehensive test suite is enough to build a completely fresh implementation of any open source library from scratch, potentially in a different language." This was triggered by Cloudflare porting Next.js to Vite in a week using AI. The implication: open-source projects with commercial models now face an existential threat from AI-powered reimplementation. Test suites are the new blueprints.
- **Why now:** This creates a new consulting niche: "AI-proof open-source strategy." Companies with open-source products need to rethink what stays public. Also relevant for Brian's own work — if he builds tools, the test suite might be more valuable than the code.
- **Effort to test:** Low — awareness item. But the pattern (AI + tests = instant reimplementation) is a powerful argument for why code ownership matters less than workflow/relationship moats.

## ⚓ SailorSkills Augmentation

### Claude Code Remote Control vs. OpenClaw — Competitive Positioning Gift
- **Source:** https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/25/claude-code-remote-control/
- **Summary:** Anthropic launched Claude Code Remote Control — control your CLI from the Claude iOS/web app. But Simon Willison found it janky: permissions gate requires approval for every action, no `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, breaks with 500 errors, and — critically — "Claude Code still doesn't have a documented mechanism for running things on a schedule, which is the other killer feature of the Claw category." Anthropic also announced Cowork scheduled tasks, but they only run while the computer is awake and the app is open.
- **Action:** This is a marketing moment. The contrast between "Claude Code Remote Control (janky, no scheduling, requires app open)" and "OpenClaw (always-on, scheduled cron jobs, Telegram interface, sub-agents)" is stark. If Brian writes about his setup, Simon's review provides the perfect foil. The quote "I really hope they're working on a Cowork Cloud product" tells you the market wants what OpenClaw already delivers.

### Stripe Data: Startups Growing 50% Faster, 60% More Apps YoY
- **Source:** https://www.saastr.com/stripes-latest-data-startups-are-growing-50-faster-computer-demand-drove-50-of-gdp-growth-60-more-apps-yoy-and-more/
- **Summary:** Stripe's 2026 annual letter shows startups growing 50% faster than the previous year, compute demand drove ~50% of GDP growth, and 60% more apps are being created YoY. Also covers agentic commerce protocols and stablecoins. SaaStr pulled out the 5 key metrics for B2B/AI companies.
- **Action:** The "60% more apps YoY" stat validates the market for AI-built software. Combined with the "agentic commerce protocols" signal, this suggests SailorSkills marketplace should be designed with agent-to-agent transactions in mind from the start.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods

### FDM-1 — Foundation Model for Computer Use (Trained on Video, Not Screenshots)
- **Source:** https://si.inc/posts/fdm1/ (220 pts on HN)
- **What it does:** SI Inc trained a foundation model on 11 million hours of screen recordings using an inverse dynamics model (IDM) to label actions. Their video encoder compresses ~2 hours of 30fps video into 1M tokens — 50x more efficient than prior state-of-the-art, 100x more efficient than OpenAI's encoder. Unlike VLM-based agents that see screenshots, FDM-1 processes continuous video, enabling long-horizon tasks like CAD design, car driving, and web fuzzing.
- **How we'd use it:** This is the next generation of computer-use agents. Not immediately actionable, but important to track. When this technology matures, "watch a pro do it, then replicate" becomes a viable training method for any domain — including marine service documentation workflows. The fuzzing demo (finding bugs by exploring states) maps interestingly to QA automation.

### OpenSwarm — Multi-Agent Claude CLI Orchestrator for Linear/GitHub
- **Source:** https://github.com/Intrect-io/OpenSwarm (Show HN, 22 pts)
- **What it does:** Orchestrates multiple Claude Code instances as autonomous agents. Picks up Linear issues, runs Worker/Reviewer pair pipelines (worker writes code, reviewer checks it, tester validates, documenter captures), reports to Discord, retains memory via LanceDB vector embeddings. Supports model escalation (start with Haiku, escalate to Sonnet after iteration 3), stuck detection, and PR auto-improvement.
- **How we'd use it:** The Worker/Reviewer pair pipeline pattern is directly applicable to any development workflow. The model escalation strategy (cheap model first, expensive model for hard problems) is a cost-optimization pattern Brian should adopt. Worth studying the architecture even if not using the tool directly.

### LLM Deanonymization at Scale — Privacy Threat to Track
- **Source:** https://simonlermen.substack.com/p/large-scale-online-deanonymization (251 pts on HN)
- **What it does:** Researchers demonstrated that LLMs can deanonymize online users by inferring personal attributes from anonymous posts, then searching the web to match identities. Tested across HN, Reddit, LinkedIn, and anonymized interview transcripts. "From a handful of comments, LLMs can infer where you live, what you do, and your interests — then search for you on the web."
- **How we'd use it:** Important for Brian's own OPSEC and for any client conversations about AI risks. Also relevant for the "responsible AI deployment" consulting angle. The research paper (arxiv:2602.16800) could be cited in any security-focused Claw deployment guide.

### Google API Keys + Gemini — Privilege Escalation by Design
- **Source:** https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/google-api-keys-werent-secrets-but-then-gemini-changed-the-rules (432 pts on HN)
- **What it does:** Google Maps API keys (designed to be public, embedded in web pages) silently gained Gemini access when projects enabled the Gemini API. 2,863 affected keys found in Common Crawl, including Google's own. Keys went from "public identifier" to "secret credential" with no warning to developers.
- **How we'd use it:** Further ammunition for the "don't trust big tech with your AI infrastructure" narrative from the Google ban wave. Also a practical security reminder: audit any Google API keys in Brian's projects for unexpected Gemini access.
