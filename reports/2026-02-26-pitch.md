# ☀️ Morning Pitch — Thursday, February 26, 2026

## The Idea
Use Simon Willison's Claude Code Remote Control review as the hook for a "OpenClaw vs. Claude Code" positioning post — he literally says "contrast this to solutions like OpenClaw."

## Why Now
Yesterday Simon Willison published his review of Anthropic's new Claude Code Remote Control feature and explicitly called out its limitations vs. OpenClaw: no scheduling, no persistent daemon, breaks on restart, requires app open. His exact quote: "It's interesting to then contrast this to solutions like OpenClaw." This is a respected voice in the AI tools community handing you a competitive positioning gift. Meanwhile, the "Ask HN" thread from 2 days ago showed real users paying $75/week for their Claws. The market is forming, the incumbent (Anthropic's own tool) is janky, and a trusted third party just said "look at this alternative." This window won't stay open long.

## What It Looks Like
- Write a blog post: "What Simon Willison Got Right About Claude Code Remote Control (And What I Built Instead)"
- Show the architecture: always-on Mac Mini daemon, Telegram interface from anywhere, 13 agents with specialized roles, cron-driven Dawn Patrol, sub-agent orchestration
- Include real comparisons: scheduling (OpenClaw: cron jobs → Claude Code: "no documented mechanism"), persistence (OpenClaw: survives restarts → Claude Code: 500 errors), mobile access (OpenClaw: Telegram → Claude Code: requires app open)
- End with the crew party angle: "In 7 days I'm demoing this at the Latitude 38 Crew Party to marine service providers"
- Cross-post the key points as a Twitter thread linking to Simon's post

## Effort vs Impact
- **Effort:** Medium — 2-3 hours to write a solid post with screenshots. But most of the content is just describing your existing setup.
- **Impact:** High — Simon's audience overlaps perfectly with potential OpenClaw consulting clients. This builds Pillar 6 (brand) and could convert to the "Claw Setup for Teams" service pitched yesterday. The credibility of a third-party endorsement is worth 10x self-promotion.

## Recommended Next Step
Draft the post outline today. Pull 3-4 screenshots from your actual setup (Dawn Patrol email, Telegram agent conversations, cron job list). Publish within 48 hours while Simon's post is still getting shared.

**📊 Pillar Alignment:** 💡 Pillar 6 (Building the Future) → Brand positioning, content, inbound consulting leads
**⚡ Powers:** 🧠 Cornered Resource (Brian's deep expertise), ⚙️ Process Power (documented workflow others can't easily replicate)
