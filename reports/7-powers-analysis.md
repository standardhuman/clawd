# SailorSkills — 7 Powers Analysis (Hamilton Helmer)

*Evaluated 2026-02-21 by Howard*
*Framework: 7 Powers: The Foundations of Business Strategy*

---

Helmer's core thesis: **Power** is the set of conditions creating the potential for *persistent differential returns*. Each Power has a **Benefit** (increases your cash flow) and a **Barrier** (prevents competitors from arbitraging that benefit away). Without Power, even great execution eventually gets competed to zero margins.

I'm evaluating two distinct businesses:
- **Business A:** SailorSkills Hull Cleaning (the diving service)
- **Business B:** SailorSkills Marketplace (the marine services directory/platform)

---

## Power 1: Scale Economies
*Per-unit costs decline as volume increases*

### Hull Cleaning: ❌ No Power
This is a body-in-the-water business. Each boat requires roughly the same time and effort regardless of how many boats you clean. There's no meaningful fixed cost to spread across more units. Going from 92 to 200 boats doesn't reduce the per-boat cost — it requires proportionally more labor (or another diver).

**Minor scale benefit:** Insurance, equipment, and vehicle costs are somewhat fixed, so there's a small per-boat cost reduction. But it's marginal and easily replicated by any competitor with 30+ boats.

### Marketplace: 🟡 Emerging
The platform has classic software scale economics — the cost to build the marketplace is fixed, but each additional user/provider costs nearly zero to serve. 530 providers and growing. The content (reviews, provider data, location pages) compounds. SEO compounds. But the scale isn't large enough yet to be a meaningful barrier.

**Verdict:** Not a source of Power yet for either business. The marketplace *could* develop Scale Economies if it reaches significant traffic.

## Power 2: Network Economies
*Value to each user increases as the userbase grows*

### Hull Cleaning: ❌ No Power
A client gets the same clean whether you have 10 clients or 200. No network effects.

### Marketplace: 🟢 **Strongest Potential Power**
This is the classic two-sided marketplace dynamic:
- More providers listed → more useful for boat owners searching → more boat owners visit
- More boat owners visiting → more leads for providers → more providers want to be listed
- More activity → more reviews → more trust → more usage

**But you're not there yet.** Network effects only kick in when you reach a critical mass where the marketplace becomes the *default* place people go. Right now it's a directory. The transformation to a true network economy requires:
1. Boat owners actually using it to find services (not just Google)
2. Providers getting leads through it (so they care about their listing)
3. Reviews/ratings creating a trust layer Google can't easily replicate

**Key question:** Can you become the "Yelp for marine services" in the Bay Area before someone else does? First-mover advantage in a local network is real — but only if you reach escape velocity.

**Verdict:** This is the most promising Power for the marketplace. Not yet achieved, but the architecture is right.

## Power 3: Counter-Positioning
*A new business model that incumbents can't copy without damaging themselves*

### Hull Cleaning: ❌ No Power
Subscription hull cleaning isn't a new model that incumbents can't copy. Any diver can offer subscriptions. There's no structural reason an existing marine service company couldn't offer what you offer.

### Marketplace: 🟡 Possible
**Against Wix/Squarespace marine directories:** Generic directory sites can't easily add the specialized marine knowledge layer (AI assistant trained on marine maintenance, service-specific categories, boat-type matching). Their business model is "build websites for everyone" — specializing in marine services would be a distraction.

**Against Google/Yelp:** They can't easily add deep marine expertise, curated provider verification, or the trust layer of a domain expert. They serve everyone; you serve boat owners. Their breadth is their weakness in your niche.

**Against traditional marine industry (Latitude 38, marina bulletin boards):** Print/analog incumbents would have to build a digital platform to compete, cannibalizing their ad-driven model.

**Verdict:** Mild Counter-Positioning exists for the marketplace against broad platforms. But it's not strong enough on its own — any funded startup could build a marine directory.

## Power 4: Switching Costs
*Customers expect a greater loss from switching than the gain*

### Hull Cleaning: 🟢 **Meaningful Power**
This is actually your strongest current Power in the diving business, and you may not fully appreciate it:

- **Relationship lock-in:** You know their boat — its quirks, its anode schedule, its growth patterns, where the barnacles always come back. A new diver starts from zero.
- **Trust with expensive assets:** Boat owners trust you with a $50K-$500K asset underwater where they can't see what's happening. That trust took months to build. Switching to an unknown diver is risky.
- **Schedule continuity:** You track their maintenance windows. Switching means potential gaps, missed cleanings, and the hassle of re-explaining everything.
- **Service log history:** With SailorSkills Pro, you'll have a complete service history per boat. That data becomes increasingly valuable and hard to replicate.
- **Convenience/reliability:** You show up consistently. The friction of finding, vetting, and scheduling a new diver is real.

**This is why your retention is 95%+.** The barrier isn't that competitors can't clean hulls — it's that switching is a pain and a risk for the boat owner.

**How to deepen this:** The more data you capture per boat (photos, conditions, anode tracking, follow-up tasks), the harder it is for a client to leave — not because you're trapping them, but because you're providing genuine accumulated value.

### Marketplace: 🟡 Potential
If providers build out their profiles, manage bookings through the platform, and accumulate reviews — switching to a different directory means losing all of that. But this doesn't exist yet.

**Verdict:** Switching Costs are your strongest existing Power in hull cleaning. Invest heavily in deepening them (service history, conditions data, client portal).

## Power 5: Branding
*Higher perceived value due to accumulated reputation*

### Hull Cleaning: 🟡 Local Brand, Not Yet Power
You have a solid reputation in Berkeley/East Bay marinas. Clients know Brian. Word of mouth works. But "SailorSkills" as a brand doesn't yet command a price premium or reduce customer acquisition cost at scale. It's personal reputation, not brand Power in Helmer's sense.

**The gap:** Brand Power means a customer chooses you over an identical service *because of the brand alone*. Right now, clients choose you because they know Brian, not because "SailorSkills" means something independent of you. That's the difference between a personal reputation and a durable brand.

**Path to Brand Power:** SailorSkills Pro (professional service reports with photos + conditions data) could build brand perception of "the most professional hull cleaning service." The marketplace could position SailorSkills as the *authority* in marine services. Content (blog, social, Crew Party presence) builds brand over time. But it takes years.

### Marketplace: 🟡 Opportunity
Being first to own "the place for Bay Area marine services" is a branding play. If you can become synonymous with that, it's durable. But you're early.

**Verdict:** No Brand Power yet. Path exists but requires sustained investment in content, quality perception, and visibility.

## Power 6: Cornered Resource
*Preferential access to a coveted resource*

### Hull Cleaning: 🟢 **Real Power**
**Brian himself is a cornered resource.** This sounds like a weakness (doesn't scale), but in Helmer's framework it's genuine Power:

- You are an experienced diver who personally knows 92+ boat owners by name
- You know the marinas, the harbormasters, the community
- You have relationships that took years to build
- You have deep domain knowledge of hull conditions, anodes, marine growth patterns in SF Bay specifically
- Your TMC/personal growth background creates a client relationship depth most service providers can't match

**The AI agent team is an emerging cornered resource.** No other hull cleaning operation has an AI team doing research, strategy, client management, and platform development. This is genuinely unusual and hard to replicate.

**The limitation:** Cornered resources that depend on one person don't survive that person. This is why the Platform pillar matters — it's about encoding Brian's knowledge into systems.

### Marketplace: 🟡 Curation Knowledge
Your personal knowledge of Bay Area marine service quality is a cornered resource for the marketplace. You know who's good, who's sketchy, who's overpriced. That curation judgment is hard for a generic directory to replicate.

**Verdict:** Cornered Resource is real Power for the hull cleaning business, centered on Brian's relationships and domain expertise. The strategic challenge is encoding it into systems so it persists.

---

## Power 7: Process Power
*Superior organization and processes that take extended time to replicate*

### Hull Cleaning: 🟡 Building
You're building toward this with SailorSkills Pro:
- Voice-recorded dive reports → AI extraction → structured service logs
- Follow-up task system with window-based scheduling
- Conditions tracking (growth levels, anode status)
- Photo/video documentation on every dive
- Client notification + invoice automation

When this is fully operational, it represents a **process advantage** that would take a competitor significant time and investment to replicate. A new diver with a wetsuit and a scraper can clean a hull, but they can't replicate your end-to-end service delivery process.

**Not yet Power:** The process isn't fully operational yet (Pro isn't in daily use, report+invoice flow isn't live). Process Power only counts when it's *actually working* and producing differential results.

### Marketplace: ❌ Too Early
No meaningful process advantages yet.

**Verdict:** Process Power is emerging in hull cleaning through the SailorSkills Pro platform. Not yet realized.

## Strategic Implications

### Hull Cleaning — "Deepen What Works"
Your two real Powers are **Switching Costs** and **Cornered Resource**. Strategy should focus on:

1. **Deepen switching costs** — Get SailorSkills Pro into daily use. Every dive report, every condition log, every follow-up task makes it harder for clients to leave (because the accumulated value is real).
2. **Encode the cornered resource** — Brian's knowledge needs to live in systems, not just Brian's head. The service log database, the AI extraction, the conditions tracking — this is how you turn a personal cornered resource into Process Power.
3. **Don't compete on price.** Your Power isn't cost-based. It's relationship and data-based. Hold at $4.50/foot and justify with service quality.

### Marketplace — "Race to Network Effects"
Your best shot at durable Power is **Network Economies**. Everything else is a bridge to get there:

1. **Reach critical mass in one geography first.** Bay Area. Get enough providers and enough boat owners that it becomes self-reinforcing.
2. **The Crew Party (March 5) is a network-building event.** Every person who checks the site, every provider who claims their listing, moves you closer to critical mass.
3. **Reviews are the flywheel.** Without reviews, it's just a directory (no network effects). With reviews, it becomes a trust layer that compounds.
4. **Curate aggressively.** Your personal curation (cornered resource) is the bridge to network effects. Use it to build initial quality, then let the network take over.

### The Biggest Risk
**Neither business has strong Power yet.** Hull cleaning has moderate Switching Costs and a Cornered Resource (Brian), but both depend on one person. The marketplace has strong *potential* for Network Economies but hasn't reached critical mass.

Helmer would say: you're in the "Getting There" phase, not the "Being There" phase. The strategic question isn't "do we have Power?" — it's "what's our most compelling path to Power?" 

The answer: **SailorSkills Pro (deepens Switching Costs + builds Process Power) and the Marketplace (races to Network Economies).** These are your two best bets, and they're exactly where you're investing.
