# ☀️ Morning Pitch — Monday, February 23, 2026

## The Idea
Launch SailorSkills hull cleaning content on Loops (federated TikTok) — first-mover in marine services on the platform everyone's talking about.

## Why Now
Loops, a federated open-source TikTok alternative, just hit open beta and exploded on Hacker News (383 points). It's ActivityPub-based, meaning content syndicates across the entire fediverse automatically. Meanwhile, the "Attention Media ≠ Social Networks" essay hit #1 on HN (593 points), validating exactly what short-form marine content is: attention media, not social networking. Hull cleaning footage — barnacle scraping, before/after reveals, underwater work — is inherently satisfying visual content. You'd be the first marine services provider on the platform. Early creators get algorithmic favor and community goodwill.

## What It Looks Like
- Start filming 30-second clips during today's dives (you have 14 boats — plenty of content opportunities)
- Post raw, satisfying clips to Loops (early mover) and cross-post to TikTok/Reels
- Content doubles as client education ("this is what 3 months of growth looks like")
- Federated = your content appears on Mastodon, Pixelfed, and every ActivityPub platform automatically
- Zero production needed — phone in a waterproof case, natural audio, real work

## Effort vs Impact
- **Effort:** Minimal — clip your GoPro footage you're already capturing, 5 min to post
- **Impact:** High — builds Pillar 6 (brand/content) with zero extra time investment, and creates a content library for the marketplace launch. First marine services creator on a buzzy new platform = press potential.

## Recommended Next Step
Create a SailorSkills account on joinloops.org today. Film 3 clips during dives. Post your first one tonight. See what happens.

**📊 Pillar Alignment:** 💡 Pillar 6 (Building the Future) → Content publishing, brand building, inbound lead generation
