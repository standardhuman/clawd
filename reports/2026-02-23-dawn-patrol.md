## 🌊 WELLBEING

Sunday was a rest day from the gym — Communication Dojo Week 4, vault work, and a massive trust network shipping session. Your body got a break even if your brain didn't.

- **Today:** Big dive day (14 boats). Hydrate hard before you hit the water. Do a 10-min morning flow focused on shoulders and hip openers — you'll be in a wetsuit for hours.
- **NVC practice with Katerina at 5pm** — nice bookend to the dive day. Don't skip it.
- **Heads up:** Communication Dojo drop-in tonight at 7pm, plus RUNDAY social run at 6:15pm. Pick one or do both — but don't burn yourself out after 14 boats.

## 🧭 PILLARS & FOCUS

### 🎯 Today's Top Actions
1. **Dive 14 boats** — full day, 8am-3:30pm. Revenue day. Excellence here.
2. **Run payroll** — Gusto notification sitting in inbox (Feb 22). Handle before diving or tonight.
3. **Reply to Michael Davidson** — he texted yesterday asking about your schedule today. Likely a dive client.
4. **NVC practice session with Katerina** — 5-6pm, confirmed.
5. **Film content clips** — GoPro a few satisfying hull shots for Loops/TikTok (see today's pitch).

### ⚠️ At Risk Flags
- **2024 personal tax return** — still unfiled, penalties growing. ~$12K exposure.
- **2025 S-Corp return** — due March 15. 20 days away.
- **SailorSkills Pro launch** — March 1 target is 6 days out. Plan-first sprint from yesterday's pitch not yet started.
- **Marketplace + Crew Party** — March 5 Latitude 38 event. 10 days.

### 📅 This Week
- SailorSkills Pro: final sprint (6 days to March 1)
- Tax returns: need CPA engagement NOW
- Communication Dojo: Week 5 (final) is Sunday March 1

## 💡 TODAY'S PITCH

**Launch SailorSkills on Loops (federated TikTok)**

Loops just hit open beta and blew up on HN (383 pts). Federated = your content auto-syndicates across the fediverse. Hull cleaning footage is inherently satisfying visual content. You'd be the first marine services creator on the platform.

- Film 30-second clips during today's 14 dives
- Post to Loops (first mover) + cross-post TikTok/Reels
- Content doubles as client education
- Zero extra time — just clip existing GoPro footage

**Next step:** Create account on joinloops.org. Film 3 clips today. Post tonight.

**Pillar:** 💡 Building the Future — content, brand, inbound leads

- **Ichiro Yamawaki** — conversation trailing off, his last msg was warm. Low priority.

## ⚡ POWER CHECK

Today's focus items and the Powers they build:

- **14 boats dived excellently** → ⚓ Switching Costs (every service deepens client lock-in) + 🧠 Cornered Resource (Brian's expertise + relationships)
- **Run payroll** → enables operations continuity (no direct Power, but protects the engine)
- **Film content clips** → 🌐 Network Economies (content feeds the marketplace flywheel, builds brand for Crew Party)
- **NVC practice** → 🧠 Cornered Resource (Brian's capacity as a leader and communicator — the bedrock asset)
- **Tax returns (flagged)** → enables 💰 Financial Health (runway to keep building Power)

**This week's #1 Power-building priority:** Ship SailorSkills Pro → ⚙️ Process Power (encoding Brian's knowledge into systems)

*Good morning, Captain. 14 boats, payroll, and a packed evening. Pace yourself.*
