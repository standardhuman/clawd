# ☀️ Morning Pitch — Wednesday, February 25, 2026

## The Idea
Offer "Claw Setup for Teams" — a paid consulting service helping small teams deploy OpenClaw for their specific workflows.

## Why Now
Yesterday's "Ask HN: Share your productive usage of OpenClaw" thread (52 pts, 26 comments) is a live market research goldmine. Real users describe exact workflows and costs: team standup bots monitoring GitHub/Linear ($75/week), personal EAs handling calendar and prioritization, apartment scanning with quality scoring. One commenter said "everybody on the team said they'd be sad if we took it away." The demand exists. The willingness to pay exists (~$300/month for a personal Claw). Nobody is packaging the setup as a service yet. Meanwhile, Pi Agent just launched standalone (320 pts on HN), making the underlying infrastructure more accessible — but also more confusing for non-technical teams. The gap between "this exists" and "I have it running for my team" is exactly where consulting lives.

## What It Looks Like
- **Productized service**: $500-$1,500 per team setup (Mac Mini + OpenClaw + custom skills for their workflow)
- **3 packages**: Personal Claw ($500, 1 user), Team Claw ($1,000, 3-5 users), Enterprise Claw ($1,500+, custom)
- **Deliverable**: Running Claw instance with custom skills, Telegram/Slack integration, cron jobs for their rhythm (standups, research briefs, triage)
- **Brian's credibility**: "I run a 92-boat hull cleaning business with a 12-agent AI team. Here's what I built for myself — let me build it for you."
- **Recurring revenue potential**: $100/month support retainer per client

## Effort vs Impact
- **Effort:** Low — Brian already has the playbook (he IS the playbook). First 3 clients could be served using existing knowledge, no new tooling needed.
- **Impact:** High — creates a new revenue stream (Pillar 6), leverages Cornered Resource (Brian's deep Claw expertise), and each deployment generates case studies for content marketing.

## Recommended Next Step
Write a 3-paragraph response in the HN thread today describing your 12-agent setup and offering to help teams get started. Include a link to briancline.co. This is warm outbound — the audience is self-selected and actively looking for guidance.

**📊 Pillar Alignment:** 💡 Pillar 6 (Building the Future) → New revenue stream, brand building, leverages AI team expertise
