# ☀️ Morning Pitch — Tuesday, February 24, 2026

## The Idea
Record a "How I Actually Run My Business with AI Agents" response video/post riding the Greg Isenberg × Obsidian + Claude Code wave.

## Why Now
Yesterday Greg Isenberg dropped an episode ("How I Use Obsidian + Claude Code to Run My Life") that will drive massive interest in AI + Obsidian workflows. Internet Vin demos slash commands and vault reading — impressive but basic. Brian's OpenClaw setup is *generations ahead*: always-on Telegram interface, 12 specialized agents, cron-driven briefings, sub-agent orchestration, Notion integration, voice memos, Kindle delivery. The episode creates demand; Brian's setup is the answer. First-mover content while the topic is hot gets algorithmic favor.

## What It Looks Like
- Short-form video (3-5 min) or Twitter/LinkedIn thread: "I watched Greg Isenberg's Obsidian + Claude Code episode. Here's what it looks like when you go further."
- Show real screenshots: Dawn Patrol on Kindle, Telegram agent conversations, automatic research briefs, cron jobs
- End with: "I run a hull cleaning business and a software platform. My AI team handles research, strategy, QA, ops, and my morning briefing. This is what's possible."
- Cross-post to Loops (your new account from yesterday's pitch)
- Links back to briancline.co or SailorSkills for inbound

## Effort vs Impact
- **Effort:** Low — 1-2 hours. Screenshots already exist. No production needed — authenticity is the point.
- **Impact:** High — rides a trending topic, positions Brian as a practitioner (not a guru), builds Pillar 6 (content/brand) and Pillar 2 (AI team visibility). Could drive inbound consulting interest.

## Recommended Next Step
Take 3-4 screenshots of your actual setup today (this Dawn Patrol, a Telegram agent conversation, your cron job list, your Obsidian vault). Draft a Twitter thread tonight after the Dojo. Post tomorrow morning while the Isenberg episode is still trending.

**📊 Pillar Alignment:** 💡 Pillar 6 (Building the Future) → Content publishing, brand building, establishing voice in AI + marine services
