# ☀️ Morning Pitch — Tuesday, February 17, 2026

## The Idea
Use the new arXiv hull-fouling research paper as a credibility weapon in SailorSkills sales materials — and show up at the Latitude 38 Crew Party on March 5 armed with it.

## Why Now
A peer-reviewed paper just validated exactly what SailorSkills sells: data-driven hull cleaning schedules reduce fuel costs by up to 5% versus fixed-time cleaning. That's independent, academic proof that your subscription model isn't just convenient — it's *optimized*. And in 16 days, every serious boat owner on the Bay will be in one room at Golden Gate Yacht Club.

## What It Looks Like
- **One-pager or postcard** citing the arXiv paper's key finding (5% fuel savings, four-year dataset) with a line like: *"Science agrees — proactive hull care pays for itself."*
- Add the citation to the SailorSkills website's value proposition section (Jacques can knock this out in an hour)
- Bring 50 printed one-pagers to the Latitude 38 Crew Party on March 5
- Use the stat in follow-up emails to leads who've gone cold — gives you a reason to re-open the conversation
- Optional: short LinkedIn post tagging the paper, positioning SailorSkills as the local service that already does what the research recommends

## Effort vs Impact
- **Effort:** Low — one-pager design + a website text update + showing up March 5
- **Impact:** High — third-party research validation is the single best trust accelerator for a service business. Every boat owner who hears "peer-reviewed study shows 5% fuel savings" will take you more seriously than any testimonial alone.

## Recommended Next Step
Have Jacques draft the one-pager today using the paper's abstract and key figures. Brian reviews tonight, and it's print-ready by end of week — well ahead of March 5.
