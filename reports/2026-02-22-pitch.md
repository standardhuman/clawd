# ☀️ Morning Pitch — Sunday, February 22, 2026

## The Idea
Formalize the Plan-First development workflow for the SailorSkills Pro final sprint — 7 days to ship.

## Why Now
The #1 post on Hacker News right now is a developer's 9-month Claude Code methodology that separates planning from execution using markdown files and annotation cycles. The key stat from the comments: one builder runs an 80K LOC personal app and one-shots most features in 5 minutes using this approach. You're already doing a version of this with Howard and Jacques — but you're not doing it *deliberately*. With SailorSkills Pro launching March 1 (7 days), formalizing the Research → Plan → Annotate → Todo → Implement pipeline for Jacques could be the difference between shipping and slipping.

## What It Looks Like
- **Today: write the plan files.** Break SailorSkills Pro into the remaining features. Each one gets a `plan-[feature].md` with the exact implementation path, code snippets, and edge cases — not a vague spec, a *blueprint*
- **Annotation cycle with Jacques:** He reads the plans, flags gaps, you revise. One round per feature
- **Todo-driven execution:** Each plan generates a concrete checklist. Jacques works through them sequentially
- **Batch in ~1,500-line chunks** (the sweet spot from the HN discussion)
- **Sunday is planning day, Mon-Fri is execution.** By Friday you're testing, not building

## Effort vs Impact
- **Effort:** Low — 2-3 hours today writing plans. Zero new tools, zero new infrastructure
- **Impact:** High — this is the difference between a chaotic sprint and a controlled ship. The March 1 deadline is real

## Recommended Next Step
Block 2 hours this morning. List every remaining feature/bug for SailorSkills Pro. Pick the 3 most critical. Write a `plan-*.md` for each one in the repo. Hand them to Jacques this afternoon with the instruction: "Annotate, don't build yet."

**📊 Pillar Alignment:** 🚀 Pillar 4 (SailorSkills Platform) → Launch SailorSkills Pro by March 1
