# ☀️ Morning Pitch — Sunday, February 22, 2026

## The Idea
Adopt the Plan-First development workflow for the SailorSkills Pro sprint — you have 7 days to March 1, and this is how you ship it.

## Why Now
The #1 post on Hacker News right now is a developer's 9-month Claude Code methodology that separates planning from execution using markdown files and annotation cycles. The key stat from the comments: one builder runs an 80K LOC personal app and one-shots most features in 5 minutes using this approach. You're already doing a version of this with Howard and Jacques — but you're not doing it *deliberately*. With SailorSkills Pro launching March 1 (7 days), formalizing the Research → Plan → Annotate → Todo → Implement pipeline for Jacques could be the difference between shipping and slipping. The SaaS crash Noa flagged reinforces the urgency: your platform isn't a SaaS play — it's operational infrastructure that makes your *service business* scalable. Ship it.

## What It Looks Like
- **Today: write the plan files.** Break SailorSkills Pro into the remaining features. Each one gets a `plan-[feature].md` with the exact implementation path, code snippets, and edge cases — not a vague spec, a *blueprint*
- **Annotation cycle with Jacques:** He reads the plans, flags gaps, you revise. One round per feature. This front-loads the thinking so implementation is mechanical
- **Todo-driven execution:** Each plan generates a concrete checklist. Jacques works through them sequentially. No ambiguity, no "figure it out as you go"
- **Batch in ~1,500-line chunks** (the sweet spot from the HN discussion) — keeps context windows manageable and output quality high
- **Sunday is planning day, Mon-Fri is execution.** By Friday you're testing, not building

## Effort vs Impact
- **Effort:** Low — 2-3 hours today writing plans. Zero new tools, zero new infrastructure. You're just adding structure to what you already do
- **Impact:** High — this is the difference between a chaotic sprint and a controlled ship. The March 1 deadline is real. Missing it means another week of "almost done" while diving eats your weekdays

## Recommended Next Step
Block 2 hours this morning. List every remaining feature/bug for SailorSkills Pro. Pick the 3 most critical. Write a `plan-*.md` for each one in the repo. Hand them to Jacques this afternoon with the instruction: "Annotate, don't build yet."

**📊 Pillar Alignment:** 🚀 Pillar 4 (SailorSkills Platform) → Launch SailorSkills Pro by March 1 → This pitch directly de-risks the launch by converting remaining dev work from ad-hoc coding into a structured, proven methodology that maximizes Jacques' output in the final 7 days
