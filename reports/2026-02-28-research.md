# Daily Research Brief — Saturday, February 28, 2026

## 🔑 Top 3 Opportunities
1. **OpenAI takes the DoW deal, Anthropic publicly refuses, and "How do I cancel my ChatGPT subscription?" hits #2 on HN with 469 points — the Great AI Platform Realignment is happening in real time.** OpenAI agreed to deploy models in the DoW's classified network. Anthropic published a response advising customers. Meanwhile the cancellation guide trending on HN is a consumer sentiment signal. Brian's Anthropic-first positioning is validated by the market splitting.
2. **Unfucked (UNF*) — filesystem flight recorder for AI agent work — launches on HN (89 pts) and solves the #1 pain point of agentic coding: agents destroying your files between commits.** Records every file change, every second, with <1% CPU. `unf restore --at 5m` reverts 47 files. This is essential safety infrastructure for anyone running Claude Code or OpenClaw agents.
3. **Free Claude Max 20x for open-source maintainers — Anthropic's developer acquisition play gives 10,000 OSS maintainers $200/month of Claude for free.** This is the most aggressive developer relations move in the AI space. It locks the most influential developers into the Anthropic ecosystem and ensures Claude becomes the default coding agent for major open-source projects.

## 💡 AI Business Opportunities

### The Great AI Platform Split — OpenAI Goes Military, Anthropic Draws Lines
- **Source:** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47186557 (OpenAI/DoW, 498 pts), https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47186101 (Anthropic response, 850 pts), https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47188521 ("Cancel ChatGPT", 469 pts)
- **Idea:** Three simultaneous HN front-page stories tell one meta-narrative: Sam Altman announced OpenAI will deploy in DoW classified networks. Anthropic published a measured response reaffirming their red lines from yesterday. And the "How do I cancel my ChatGPT subscription?" help page hit 469 points — a consumer protest vote. Combined with OpenAI's $110B raise at a $730B valuation (469 pts), the AI market is splitting into distinct camps: military-industrial (OpenAI), trust-first (Anthropic), and enterprise-embedded (Google). The HN comment "We are exclusively using Anthropic because it's what is available in AWS Bedrock and it works. These things are solidifying fast" captures the enterprise mood.
- **Why now:** Platform choice is becoming identity. Developers and companies choosing Anthropic are making a values statement, not just a technical one. This creates natural segmentation for consulting: "I help companies build on the responsible AI stack" is now a positioning that resonates.
- **Effort to test:** Low — Brian's already positioned here. Use the contrast in any client or partner conversations. The cancellation wave is a lead generation moment for "switch to Claude" consulting.

### Max Woolf's "AI Agent Coding Skeptic" Post — The Definitive Convert Story
- **Source:** https://minimaxir.com/2026/02/ai-agent-coding/ (featured on Simon Willison's blog)
- **Idea:** Max Woolf, a well-known ML skeptic, published an exhaustive post documenting his conversion from "agents are overhyped" to "I'm porting scikit-learn to Rust with agents and it keeps working." The key insight for Brian: Max's AGENTS.md file is the differentiator. He shares a detailed Python-oriented AGENTS.md with rules like "NEVER use emoji" and "MUST avoid redundant comments" that dramatically improve output quality. His quote: "Opus 4.6/Codex 5.3 are an order of magnitude better than coding LLMs released months before and it's impossible to say that publicly without sounding like a hype booster."
- **Why now:** This is the best social proof piece for anyone selling AI coding services. A known skeptic with a technical audience converts and shares his exact methodology. The AGENTS.md-as-differentiator insight maps directly to what Brian does with OpenClaw — the configuration layer IS the product.
- **Effort to test:** Low — Share Max's AGENTS.md template with clients as a starting point. Use his conversion story as a case study in any "why AI coding actually works now" conversation.

### OpenAI Raises $110B at $730B Valuation — What the HN Discussion Reveals
- **Source:** https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47184133 (469 pts, 516 comments)
- **Idea:** OpenAI's latest raise makes it the most expensive private company ever. But the HN discussion is remarkably bearish. Top comments focus on: the valuation makes no economic sense at current revenue, Microsoft's position is weakening, and the DoW deal looks like a pivot to government revenue because consumer PMF isn't there. One commenter notes the raise structure likely includes preferential liquidation preferences, meaning later investors eat first. Combined with Benedict Evans' analysis from two days ago (OpenAI lacks PMF), this validates the thesis that OpenAI is a finance story, not a product story.
- **Why now:** The higher OpenAI's valuation goes without matching PMF, the more the market fragments. Developers are already choosing alternatives. The $730B valuation creates expectations that can only be met by enterprise/government contracts, which pushes the consumer/developer market further toward Anthropic and open-source alternatives.
- **Effort to test:** N/A — strategic context. Reinforces Brian's Anthropic positioning.

## ⚓ SailorSkills Augmentation

### Anthropic's Free Claude Max for OSS Maintainers — Developer Ecosystem Play
- **Source:** https://claude.com/contact-sales/claude-for-oss (via Simon Willison, HN)
- **Summary:** Anthropic is offering free Claude Max 20x ($200/month value) to maintainers of repos with 5,000+ GitHub stars or 1M+ NPM downloads, for 6 months, up to 10,000 contributors. The Express.js/Lodash maintainer's comment is telling: "This is the most generous gift I've seen" from any AI company to OSS. The small print says "if you maintain something the ecosystem quietly depends on, apply anyway."
- **Action:** Not directly applicable to SailorSkills, but important ecosystem signal. If Brian builds any open-source tooling (Claw skills, marketplace components), getting it past 5K stars would qualify for this program. More broadly: Anthropic is investing in locking in developer loyalty at the infrastructure layer, which further validates building on their stack.

### Unfucked (UNF*) as Agent Safety Net for Development
- **Source:** https://unfudged.io (89 pts, Show HN)
- **Summary:** A filesystem flight recorder that watches your project directory and records every file change with sub-second granularity. Uses FSEvents on macOS, BLAKE3 content hashing, SQLite storage. <1% CPU, <100MB RAM. `unf restore --at 5m` can revert an entire agent-destroyed workspace. Retention: 24h full resolution, 7d hourly, 30d daily. Free, local-only, no cloud.
- **Action:** Install this on Brian's Mac Mini immediately. Every OpenClaw/Claude Code session should have UNF running. The "agent mass-overwrote your source" use case is exactly what happens when sub-agents go rogue. This is cheap insurance — zero cost, zero performance impact. Also recommend to any Claw deployment clients.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods

### Claude-File-Recovery — Forensic Tool for Claude Code Sessions
- **Source:** https://github.com/hjtenklooster/claude-file-recovery (75 pts, Show HN)
- **What it does:** Parses Claude Code's JSONL session transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` and reconstructs every file that was ever created, modified, or read across all sessions. Interactive TUI with fuzzy search, point-in-time recovery, colored diffs. Parallel parsing with fast-reject byte checks that skip 77% of lines.
- **How we'd use it:** Complements UNF* for different scenarios. UNF* prevents file loss going forward; claude-file-recovery lets you mine historical sessions for files you forgot to save. Together they form a complete safety net for agentic coding. Install both.

### Simon Willison's Unicode Explorer — HTTP Range Request Pattern
- **Source:** https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/27/ (tools.simonwillison.net/unicode-binary-search)
- **What it does:** Simon built a Unicode explorer from his phone using Claude Code, demonstrating binary search over HTTP range requests against large files. The interesting pattern: kick off an "asynchronous research project" with Claude Code against a GitHub repo, then review the resulting report and code later.
- **How we'd use it:** The "async research project" workflow is the pattern Brian already uses with OpenClaw sub-agents. Simon's validation of this approach from the Claude Code side confirms it's becoming standard practice. The HTTP range request technique itself is a useful trick for building data tools that work on large remote files without downloading them.

### Manim Ported to TypeScript — Math Animations in the Browser
- **Source:** https://github.com/maloyan/manim-ts (83 pts, Show HN)
- **What it does:** Port of 3Blue1Brown's Manim animation library to TypeScript, enabling mathematical animations to run directly in the browser without Python.
- **How we'd use it:** Niche but relevant if Brian ever builds educational content for SailorSkills (e.g., explaining hull cleaning science, anode corrosion chemistry, or marketplace dynamics with animated visualizations). More broadly, it's another example of the "port mature Python tools to the browser" trend that AI agents are accelerating.

## 🔍 New Sources Discovered
- **Max Woolf / minimaxir** (minimaxir.com) — ML engineer and well-known skeptic. His agent coding conversion post is the most methodical writeup on AGENTS.md effectiveness. His Python AGENTS.md template is a shareable resource.
- **Unfucked / Cyrus Radfar** (unfudged.io) — Agent safety tooling. Worth tracking for updates as the "agent recovery" category develops.
