# ☀️ Dawn Patrol — Sunday, February 22, 2026

## 🌊 WELLBEING (Rio)

Yesterday was all platform work — Build 43 shipped, marketplace got provider cards, sitemap, quote flow. No gym, no ride, no run. Heavy screen day with dopamine diet kicking in at 7pm (good).

- **Today's movement:** Sunday recovery flow — 15 min gentle yoga focusing on hip flexors and thoracic spine. You've been sitting and coding. Open everything up.
- **Wellness nudge:** You have two mindfulness events today (Communication in Intimate Relationships 10am, Sunday Sangha 7pm). Beautiful bookends. Stay hydrated between them — you tend to forget water on deep-work days.

## 🧭 PILLARS & FOCUS (PPV)

*Note: Notion API unavailable this morning (1Password timeout). Pulling from yesterday's memory + known priorities.*

### 🎯 Today's Top Actions
1. **Write plan files for SailorSkills Pro sprint** — 7 days to March 1 launch. Today is planning day. (Pillar 4: Platform)
2. **Run payroll** — Gusto is waiting for Feb 27 payroll confirmation (Pillar 5: Financial)
3. **Reply to Rutwij from Bloom** — he reached out about connecting, lives in South Berkeley (Pillar 1: Wellbeing / TMC)
4. **Attend Communication in Intimate Relationships** — 10am-12pm (Pillar 1: Wellbeing)
5. **Sunday Sangha** — 7pm-9pm (Pillar 1: Wellbeing)

### ⚠️ At Risk
- **SailorSkills Pro launch (March 1)** — 7 days out. Email/invoice/charge flow specced but not built. Follow-up badges just fixed in Build 43. This is the critical path.
- **2024 tax return** — still overdue with ~$12K penalties accruing
- **2025 S-Corp return** — due March 15 (21 days)

### 📅 This Week
- Mon-Fri: Pro sprint execution (if you plan today)
- TMC Wednesday circle
- Feb 27: Payroll runs
- March 1: Pro launch target

## 💡 TODAY'S PITCH (Kai)

**The Idea:** Formalize the Plan-First development workflow for the SailorSkills Pro final sprint — 7 days to ship.

**Why Now:** The #1 HN post right now is a developer's Claude Code methodology: Research → Plan → Annotate → Todo → Implement. One builder runs 80K LOC and one-shots features in 5 minutes. You're already doing a version of this — but not deliberately. With March 1 in 7 days, structuring Jacques' work through plan files could be the difference between shipping and slipping.

**What It Looks Like:**
- Block 2 hours today: list every remaining Pro feature/bug
- Write a plan-[feature].md for the top 3 critical items
- Hand to Jacques for annotation (not building — reviewing)
- Monday starts execution against concrete checklists

**Pillar Alignment:** 🚀 Platform (Pillar 4) → directly de-risks March 1 launch

## ⚡ POWER CHECK

| Today's Focus | Power Built |
|---|---|
| Pro sprint planning | ⚙️ Process Power — encoding Brian's service knowledge into systems |
| Run payroll | 💰 (Enables investment — keeps ops running) |
| Communication workshop | 🧠 Cornered Resource — Brian's emotional intelligence is the asset |
| Sunday Sangha | 🧠 Cornered Resource — deepening the human behind the brand |
| Reply to Bloom/Rutwij | 🌐 Network Economies — expanding community connections |

**Flag:** Payroll is pure maintenance — doesn't build Power directly, but failure to run it erodes everything. No waste here today. Sunday is appropriately weighted toward Cornered Resource (Brian himself).

*Brewed at 9:50am. Coffee's ready. Phone stays off until after the workshop.* ☕
