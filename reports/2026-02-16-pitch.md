# ☀️ Morning Pitch — February 16, 2026

## The Idea
Use the new academic paper on data-driven hull cleaning ROI as the centerpiece of a one-page sales asset that quantifies why subscription cleaning pays for itself.

## Why Now
A peer-reviewed paper (arxiv, Feb 11) just validated that optimized hull cleaning schedules reduce fuel consumption by up to 5% — even after accounting for cleaning costs. This is third-party academic proof of exactly what SailorSkills sells. The timing is perfect: boat show season is peaking (Miami just wrapped), and Bay Area owners are prepping for spring sailing.

## What It Looks Like
- A one-page PDF or landing page section: "The Math Behind Clean Hulls"
- Lead with the 5% fuel savings stat, cite the paper, then translate it to recreational boats (e.g., "For a 40-footer burning $300/mo in fuel, that's $180/year back in your pocket — more than covering a cleaning subscription")
- Include a simple before/after comparison: subscription cleaning vs. reactive haul-outs
- Use it in three places: email to current leads, attach to proposals, post on the SailorSkills site
- Optional: have Marcel design it so it looks sharp

## Effort vs Impact
- **Effort:** Low — half a day to draft copy and run the numbers; Marcel can polish it
- **Impact:** High — gives every sales conversation a credibility anchor backed by real research

## Recommended Next Step
Forward the paper link to Jacques or Howard and ask them to pull the key data points into a draft one-pager. Brian reviews over coffee tomorrow.
