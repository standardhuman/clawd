# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## Obsidian Vault

**Path:** `~/Documents/Brian's Vault/`

Key folders:
- `SailorSkills/` — Architecture diagrams (mermaid), Business docs, Development notes
- `SailorSkills/Architecture/ecosystem-diagram.md` — Main platform architecture with embedded Mermaid

## Notion

**Diving Client List** — SailorSkills customer database
- database_id: `0ae0e330-780b-4764-956e-12e8ee344ea2`
- Use API version `2022-06-28` (not 2025-09-03)

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases  
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Architecture Docs Workflow

- **Canonical source**: Mermaid diagrams in markdown (version-controlled, editable by Howard)
- **Location**: `~/AI/business/sailorskills/docs/architecture/ecosystem-diagram.md`
- **Obsidian copy**: `~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Brian's Vault/SailorSkills/Architecture/`
- **Workflow**: Brian thinks out loud (Wispr Flow) → Howard edits Mermaid → Brian views in Obsidian
- **Excalidraw**: Keep for whiteboarding only, not source of truth

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
