# SailorSkills Directory Launch — Marketing Drafts

*Ready for Brian to review and personalize. Items marked [BRIAN: ...] need his input.*

## 1. Customer Email Blast

**Subject:** I built something for you (and everyone at the marina)

---

Hey [BRIAN: first name or "there"],

You know how you're always asking me who I'd recommend for electrical work, or whether I know a good diesel mechanic? I finally built the thing.

**SailorSkills is now a marine services directory** — 500+ providers across the Bay Area, from hull cleaners to riggers to surveyors. Search by service, location, or rating.

I'm still cleaning bottoms (that hasn't changed). But now when you need something I don't do, you can find it at **sailorskills.com** instead of posting in a Facebook group and hoping for the best.

There's also an AI boat expert on there if you've got a quick maintenance question at 11pm and don't want to bug me.

Check it out: **[sailorskills.com](https://sailorskills.com)**

If you know a good provider who should be listed, hit reply and let me know.

— Brian

[BRIAN: Send via YAMM or personal email? YAMM for scale, personal email for the ~20 clients you know well.]

## 3. Latitude 38 Crew Party (March 5) Talking Points

### 30-Second Elevator Pitch

"I'm Brian — I run a hull cleaning service in the East Bay. I kept getting asked for referrals to other marine services, so I built a directory. SailorSkills dot com — 500+ providers across the Bay Area. Hull cleaners, mechanics, electricians, riggers, you name it. Free to search, all the contact info right there. Check it out."

### 2-Minute Expanded Version

Start with the 30-second version, then:

"The problem was always the same — someone at the dock says 'hey, know a good diesel guy?' and you either know someone or you don't. Facebook groups are hit or miss. Google gives you auto repair shops, not marine specialists.

So I scraped every marine service provider in the Bay Area, verified the ones I know personally, and put them all in one place. You can search by service type, by city, or just browse. Every listing has phone, website, Google Maps link, ratings.

There's also an AI assistant on there — trained on marine maintenance knowledge. So if you've got a 'why is my engine doing this weird thing' question at midnight, you can ask it before calling anyone.

Long term I want providers to claim their listings and showcase their work. Think Yelp but just for boat stuff, built by someone who actually dives on boats."

### Conversation Starters
- "What marina are you at?" → "Have you tried finding a [service] there? That's exactly why I built this..."
- "What do you do?" → Skip to pitch
- "I've been having trouble with my [boat problem]" → "Actually, I built something for exactly that..."

### What to Have Ready
- Phone with sailorskills.com loaded (show the search, show a provider listing)
- [BRIAN: Business cards? Even simple ones with name + QR code + "sailorskills.com"]
- A few specific provider names to drop: "Yeah, [provider] is listed — great rating, I've used them myself"

### Key Differentiator
You're not a tech bro building a directory. You're a diver who's been on 170+ hulls in the East Bay and built the tool you wished existed. Lead with credibility, not features.

## 4. Facebook Group Posts

### Post A — SF Bay Sailors (largest group)

**Post:**

I put together a directory of marine service providers in the Bay Area — 500+ businesses, everything from hull cleaning to diesel mechanics to riggers.

It's at sailorskills.com — free to search, no account needed.

I built it because I got tired of seeing the same "anyone know a good [X]?" posts (and giving the same answers). Every listing has phone, website, ratings, and Google Maps link.

If you know a provider who should be listed, or if someone's info is wrong, let me know. Trying to make it actually useful.

[BRIAN: Don't post in multiple groups the same day — space them 2-3 days apart so it doesn't look like spam. Start with SF Bay Sailors, then Berkeley Marina Community a few days later.]

---

### Post B — Berkeley Marina Community

**Post:**

For anyone at Berkeley Marina looking for marine services — I built a free directory at sailorskills.com.

I clean hulls in the East Bay and kept a running list of other providers. Finally turned it into a searchable site. You can filter by service type (electrical, mechanical, rigging, canvas, etc.) and it shows phone/website/ratings.

Figured it might save some of you the "does anyone know a good ___?" posts. Happy to add anyone I'm missing.

### Post C — General Bay Area Boating Groups

**Post:**

Quick resource share for Bay Area boat owners — I built a directory of marine service providers at sailorskills.com.

500+ listings across the Bay. Search by service type or city. Each listing has direct contact info, website, ratings, and a Google Maps link. Free, no signup.

Built it because I do hull cleaning and kept getting asked for referrals to everything else. If you know a provider who should be on there, I'm happy to add them.

[BRIAN: All Facebook posts should come from your personal account, not a business page. People trust humans in groups, not brands. Respond to every comment — engagement is everything for reach.]
