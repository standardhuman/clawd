# Pillars — Brian Cline

*These are the life areas that matter most. Every project, every task, every agent's work should trace back to one of these. If it doesn't connect to a Pillar, ask why you're doing it.*

---

## ⚓ Pillar 1: SailorSkills Operations
**The hull cleaning business that pays the bills.**

The foundation. 92+ boats, ~$6,400/month, the thing that funds everything else. Excellence here means: every boat cleaned on schedule, every client feels personally cared for, every invoice goes out on time.

**Value Goals:**
- Deliver consistently excellent service (zero missed boats, video on every dive)
- Grow to 120+ boats by end of 2026
- Maintain 95%+ client retention
- Streamline operations so diving takes 15 hrs/week max

**Agents:** Quinn (ops/finance), Sage (sales/retention), Howard (coordination)

---

## 🚀 Pillar 2: SailorSkills Platform
**The technology that scales the business beyond Brian's body.**

The platform is what turns a one-person service into a company. Client portal, service logs, scheduling, eventually a marketplace for marine services.

**Value Goals:**
- Launch SailorSkills Pro (March 1 target — Jacques)
- Build client-facing service log access
- Automate scheduling and billing
- Create the foundation for multi-diver operations

**Agents:** Jacques (dev), Reese (product), Blake (QA)

---

## 💡 Pillar 3: Innovation & Moonshots
**New ideas, new products, new revenue streams.**

The pipeline that keeps the business evolving. Noa scans the landscape, Kai pitches ideas, Brian decides what's worth pursuing. Not everything ships — but the pipeline never stops.

**Value Goals:**
- Evaluate 2+ new ideas per week
- Ship 1 new product/feature per quarter
- Stay ahead of industry shifts (marine tech, AI tooling)
- Build things that serve real people, not tech for tech's sake

**Agents:** Noa (research), Kai (strategy), Reese (specs), Jacques (build)

---

## 📢 Pillar 4: Brand & Growth
**Getting visible. Earning trust at scale.**

Brian's reputation is his moat. This pillar is about extending that reputation beyond word-of-mouth — through content, presence, and authentic marketing.

**Value Goals:**
- Publish 1+ piece of content per week
- Build email list to 500+ subscribers by end of 2026
- Establish Brian as a recognized voice in marine services
- Drive inbound leads so Sage can convert them

**Agents:** Milo (marketing), Marcel (design), Sage (sales)

---

## 💰 Pillar 5: Financial Health
**Revenue, margins, savings, tax optimization.**

Money is a tool, not a goal — but running out of it ends everything else. This pillar ensures the business is profitable, taxes are handled, and Brian isn't surprised by anything financial.

**Value Goals:**
- File 2024 personal return (overdue — ~$12K with penalties)
- File 2025 S-Corp return by March 15
- Establish monthly financial review rhythm
- Build 6-month emergency fund
- Optimize tax strategy with CPA

**Agents:** Quinn (finance), Howard (coordination), Avery (tax compliance)

---

## 🧭 Pillar 6: Personal Growth & Wellbeing
**Health, relationships, learning, becoming.**

The human behind the company. Without this pillar, everything else eventually breaks. Sailing, biking, NVC, TMC, intentional relationships, rest.

**Value Goals:**
- Maintain physical practice (biking, sailing, movement)
- Deepen TMC involvement and men's work
- Continue intentional partner search (authenticity over apps)
- Practice digital boundaries (phones off 7pm-7am)
- Keep learning (teaching, coaching, personal development)

**Agents:** Howard (support, scheduling), Noa (relevant research)

---

## 🤖 Pillar 7: AI Agent Team
**Build and mature the agent workforce.**

The team itself is a product. Making agents more capable, more reliable, and more autonomous directly multiplies everything above.

**Value Goals:**
- Stand up all 8 sub-agents by end of Q1
- Establish review rhythm (daily brief, weekly review, monthly goals)
- Reduce AI costs to <$200/month
- Build cross-agent handoff reliability
- Evolve Mission Control into operational command center

**Agents:** Howard (orchestrator), Blake (QA), all agents (self-improvement)

---

*Review rhythm:*
- **Daily:** Kai's morning pitch (innovation), Howard's brief (operations)
- **Weekly:** Howard runs alignment check — are active projects connected to Pillars?
- **Monthly:** Goal outcome review — are we moving the numbers?
- **Quarterly:** Pillar review — are these still the right Pillars?
