# Pillars — Brian Cline

*These are the life areas that matter most, in order of priority. Every project, every task, every agent's work should trace back to one of these. If it doesn't connect to a Pillar, ask why you're doing it.*

*Pillars are ordered by foundation — the top ones must be solid before the lower ones can thrive.*

---

## 🧭 Pillar 1: Physical & Emotional Wellbeing
**The bedrock. Without a healthy Brian, nothing else works.**

This isn't a "nice to have" — it's the foundation under every other pillar. Physical health, emotional processing, relationships, rest, boundaries. If this breaks, everything breaks.

**Fitness Goals:**
- Strength training: consistent program (progressive overload, compound lifts) 3x/week
- Cardio: running and biking (indoor or outdoor) 3x/week
- Mobility: dedicated stretching and yoga routine 3x/week (develop this — focus on hip flexors, hamstrings, thoracic spine, calves/ankles to complement lifting + cycling + running)

**Emotional & Relational Goals:**
- Deepen TMC involvement and men's work
- Continue intentional partner search (authenticity over apps)
- Practice digital boundaries (phones off 7pm-7am)
- Keep learning (teaching, coaching, personal development)
- Maintain ACA/NVC practices

**Measurable Targets:**
- Strength training 3x/week
- Cardio (run or ride) 3x/week
- Stretching/yoga routine 3x/week (develop this)
- TMC Wednesday circle weekly attendance
- Phones off by 7pm, back on 7am

**Agents:** Howard (support, scheduling, accountability), Noa (relevant research)

## 🤖 Pillar 2: AI Agent Team
**The force multiplier. The primary lever that amplifies every other pillar.**

The team itself is foundational infrastructure — not a side project. Making agents more capable, more reliable, and more autonomous directly multiplies everything above AND below. This includes supporting Pillar 1 (tracking fitness, scheduling, accountability) and driving Pillar 6 (innovation, brand, growth) largely autonomously.

**Value Goals:**
- All 12 agents operational and producing value ✅
- Establish review rhythm (daily brief, weekly review, monthly goals)
- Reduce AI costs to <$200/month
- Build cross-agent handoff reliability
- Evolve Mission Control into operational command center
- Automate Pillar 6 work (research, content, outreach) so Brian focuses on Pillars 1-5

**Agents:** Howard (orchestrator), Blake (QA), Jacques (dev), Marcel (creative), all agents (self-improvement)

## ⚓ Pillar 3: SailorSkills Operations
**The hull cleaning business that pays the bills.**

The engine. 92+ boats, ~$6,400/month, the thing that funds everything else. Excellence here means: every boat cleaned on schedule, every client feels personally cared for, every invoice goes out on time.

**Value Goals:**
- Deliver consistently excellent service (zero missed boats, video on every dive)
- Grow to 120+ boats by end of 2026
- Maintain 95%+ client retention
- Streamline operations so diving takes 15 hrs/week max

**Agents:** Quinn (ops/finance), Sage (sales/retention), Howard (coordination)

---

## 🚀 Pillar 4: SailorSkills Platform
**The technology that scales the business beyond Brian's body.**

The platform is what turns a one-person service into a company. Client portal, service logs, scheduling, eventually a marketplace for marine services. This is what makes Operations sustainable if Brian can't dive.

**Value Goals:**
- Launch SailorSkills Pro (March 1 target)
- Build client-facing service log access
- Automate scheduling and billing
- Create the foundation for multi-diver operations

**Agents:** Jacques (dev), Reese (product), Blake (QA)

---

## 💰 Pillar 5: Financial Health
**Revenue, margins, savings, tax optimization.**

Money is a tool, not a goal — but running out of it ends everything else. This pillar ensures the business is profitable, taxes are handled, and Brian isn't surprised by anything financial.

**Value Goals:**
- File 2024 personal return (overdue — ~$12K with penalties)
- File 2025 S-Corp return by March 15
- Establish monthly financial review rhythm
- Build 6-month emergency fund
- Optimize tax strategy with CPA

**Agents:** Quinn (finance), Howard (coordination), Avery (tax compliance)

---

## 💡 Pillar 6: Building the Future
**Innovation, brand, growth — largely agent-driven.**

This combines forward-looking work: new business ideas, content, marketing, and growth. These are important but downstream of the first five pillars. The AI team should drive most of this autonomously — Noa scouts, Kai pitches, Milo creates content, Marcel designs, Sage converts.

**Value Goals:**
- Evaluate 2+ new ideas per week (Noa → Kai pipeline)
- Ship 1 new product/feature per quarter
- Publish 1+ content piece per week
- Build email list to 500+ subscribers by end of 2026
- Establish Brian as a recognized voice in marine services
- Drive inbound leads so Sage can convert them
- Stay ahead of industry shifts (marine tech, AI tooling)

**Agents:** Noa (research), Kai (strategy), Milo (marketing), Marcel (design), Sage (sales), Reese (product specs)

---

*Review rhythm:*
- **Daily:** Kai's morning pitch (innovation), Howard's brief (operations)
- **Weekly:** Howard runs alignment check — are active projects connected to Pillars?
- **Monthly:** Goal outcome review — are we moving the numbers?
- **Quarterly:** Pillar review — are these still the right Pillars?
