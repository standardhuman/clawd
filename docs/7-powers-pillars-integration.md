# 7 Powers × Pillars Integration

*Framework: Each Pillar builds toward specific Powers (Hamilton Helmer). Reviews should evaluate not just goal progress but Power-building.*

## Pillar → Power Mapping

| Pillar | Primary Power | Secondary Power | Key Question |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 🧭 Wellbeing | Cornered Resource | — | Is Brian healthy enough to be the asset? |
| 🤖 AI Agent Team | Cornered Resource | Process Power | Is the team widening the capability moat? |
| ⚓ Operations | Switching Costs | Cornered Resource | Is every service deepening client lock-in? |
| 🚀 Platform | Process Power | Switching Costs | Are we encoding knowledge into systems? |
| 💰 Financial Health | (Enables investment) | — | Do we have runway to keep building Power? |
| 💡 Building the Future | Network Economies | Counter-Positioning | Are we racing toward critical mass? |

## Power Status (Current)

| Power | Status | Where It Lives | Acceleration Path |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Switching Costs | 🟢 Moderate | Operations (client relationships, trust) | Get Pro into daily use → service history compounds |
| Cornered Resource | 🟢 Moderate | Brian + AI team | Encode Brian's knowledge into platform; grow team capabilities |
| Process Power | 🟡 Building | Platform (Pro) | Ship follow-ups → on-device transcription → report+invoice → full automated service delivery |
| Network Economies | 🔴 Pre-critical | Marketplace | Curate 500 providers → Crew Party → reviews → SEO traffic → flywheel |
| Branding | 🟡 Local only | Operations + Future | Content, Crew Party presence, "most professional" positioning via Pro reports |
| Counter-Positioning | 🟡 Mild | Marketplace vs generalists | Deepen marine specialization; AI assistant as differentiator |
| Scale Economies | ❌ Not applicable | — | Marketplace could develop if it reaches significant traffic |

## Review Integration

### Daily Evening Check-in
- For each completed action: did it build Power? Which one?
- Flag actions that don't connect to any Power (potential waste)

### Weekly Review  
- Power Status check: has any Power strengthened or weakened this week?
- Identify the #1 Power-building action for next week

### Monthly Review
- Full Power assessment update
- Are we on track to reach the next Power threshold?
- Reassess acceleration priorities

### Quarterly Review
- Compare Power status to start of quarter
- Have any Powers been achieved (moved from Building → Established)?
- Adjust Pillar priorities if Power landscape has changed

## Power Thresholds (What "Getting There" Looks Like)

**Switching Costs → Established when:**
- Pro in daily use for 30+ consecutive days
- 50+ boats with complete service history in system
- Client portal live (owners can see their boat's history)

**Process Power → Established when:**
- Full voice → report → invoice pipeline running without manual intervention
- Follow-up task system actively preventing missed maintenance
- A new diver could onboard and deliver Brian-quality service using the system

**Network Economies → Established when:**
- Marketplace generating 10+ inbound leads/month for providers
- Providers actively managing their listings (not just Brian curating)
- Reviews accumulating organically
- Organic search traffic > direct traffic

**Cornered Resource → Deepened when:**
- AI team handling 50%+ of administrative/research work autonomously
- Brian's client relationships encoded in system (not just in his head)
- Knowledge base sufficient that a new team member could serve clients effectively
