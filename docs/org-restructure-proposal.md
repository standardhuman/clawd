# Org Restructure — February 25, 2026

## Problem
Howard is a bottleneck. All 12 agents report to him. Brian is disconnected from strategic conversations. Too many hops between Brian and the people doing the work.

## Principles (Industry Best Practices)
- **CEO direct reports: 4-6** (Amazon, Google, Apple average 5-7)
- **Span of control: 3-5 per manager** (military, consulting, tech)
- **Group by mission, not function** — squads > departments at this scale
- **Chief of Staff enables the CEO, doesn't replace them** — Howard should amplify Brian's capacity, not be a layer between Brian and the team
- **Every agent is always-on staff** — no more "consultants spawned on demand"

## New Structure

```
                         Brian (CEO)
              ┌──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┐
              │      │      │      │      │
          Howard   Jacques  Marcel  Quinn  Rio
          (CoS)    (Eng)   (Product) (Biz)  (Well)
           │        │       │        │
         Noa 🔍   Blake 🧪 Reese 📋 Sage 💰
         Kai 💡   Cyrus 🔒 Milo 📣  Avery ⚖️
```

### Brian's Direct Reports (5)
| Who | Title | Domain |
|-----|-------|--------|
| **Howard 🪨** | Chief of Staff | Org ops, memory, scheduling, daily rhythm, cross-team coordination |
| **Jacques 🤿** | Head of Engineering | Pro app, platform infra, technical architecture |
| **Marcel 🎨** | Head of Product & Design | Marketplace, UX, brand, content creative |
| **Quinn 📊** | Head of Business Operations | Finance, invoicing, compliance, client ops |
| **Rio 🌊** | Head of Wellbeing | Pillar 1 — reports directly because it's the #1 pillar |

### Team Leads & Their Reports

**Howard's Team (Strategy & Intelligence)**
- Noa 🔍 — Research (feeds into strategy, not operations)
- Kai 💡 — Strategy (synthesizes research into pitches)

*Why under Howard:* Research and strategy serve Brian's decision-making. Howard curates what reaches Brian — not as a gatekeeper, but as a quality filter.

**Jacques' Team (Engineering)**
- Blake 🧪 — QA (reviews Jacques' and Marcel's code)
- Cyrus 🔒 — Security (reviews infrastructure, dependencies, deploys)

*Why under Jacques:* Engineering quality and security are technical concerns. Jacques is the technical leader and should own the quality bar.

**Marcel's Team (Product & Growth)**
- Reese 📋 — Product Management (specs, roadmap, user research)
- Milo 📣 — Marketing & Growth (content, SEO, campaigns)

*Why under Marcel:* Product and marketing are deeply linked — what we build and how we tell the story. Marcel's creative eye ties them together.

**Quinn's Team (Business Operations)**
- Sage 💰 — Sales & Client Relations (leads, proposals, retention)
- Avery ⚖️ — Legal & Compliance (contracts, insurance, tax deadlines)

*Why under Quinn:* Sales, finance, and legal are all business operations. Quinn's systems thinking keeps them coordinated.

### Rio (Solo — Direct to Brian)
No reports. Wellbeing is too important to be filtered through anyone. Rio talks directly to Brian about Pillar 1.

## What Changes

### Howard's Role Evolves
**Before:** Route all work, manage all agents, be the middleman
**After:** 
- Strategic advisor to Brian (not a layer)
- Manages the daily rhythm (Dawn Patrol, Evening Debrief, memory)
- Cross-team coordinator when squads need to collaborate
- Oversees research & strategy pipeline (Noa → Kai)
- Handles Brian's calendar, scheduling, logistics

Howard is more like a White House Chief of Staff — controls the information flow, sets the agenda, coordinates across teams, but the department heads report to the President.

### Brian's Engagement
- **Daily standup:** Brief async check-in with all 5 leads (via Dawn Patrol)
- **Weekly 1:1s:** Howard synthesizes, but Brian sees each lead's update directly
- **Strategic decisions:** Brian hears pitches directly, not filtered through Howard
- **Escalations:** Any lead can escalate directly to Brian

### Communication Flow
- **Vertical:** Each lead manages their team autonomously
- **Horizontal:** Cross-squad collaboration goes through Howard (coordinator, not approver)
- **Up:** Leads surface decisions to Brian; Howard ensures nothing falls through cracks
- **Down:** Brian's priorities flow through Howard to all leads

## Always-On Infrastructure

Every agent gets:
- Their own workspace directory
- AGENTS.md (their operating instructions)
- SOUL.md (their identity)
- IDENTITY.md (who they are)
- MEMORY.md (their continuity)
- Dedicated OpenClaw agent config (not spawned ad-hoc)

This means they maintain context across sessions, build institutional knowledge, and operate as permanent staff — not consultants.
