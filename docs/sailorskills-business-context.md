Founded and operated by Brian Cline, the business services ~92 boats generating approximately $6,400/month in revenue. The company differentiates itself through technology-enabled service delivery, high-quality documentation, and a focus on recurring subscriptions.

## 1. Client Profile

### Demographics
- **Primary location**: Berkeley Marina (100% of current clients)
- **Boat types**: Predominantly sailboats (90%+), some powerboats, one commercial vessel
- **Size range**: 22-70 feet in length
- **Usage patterns**: Mostly weekend sailors and racers, with a few liveaboards mixed in

### Acquisition
- **Primary channel**: Word of mouth and reputation within the marina community
- **Referral pattern**: "Who's your guy for this?" marine services culture
- **Market penetration**: Currently services ~10% of boats in Berkeley Marina

## 2. Value Proposition

### Core Problems Solved
1. **Protection**: Removing marine growth fouling to protect boat hulls
2. **Performance**: Maintaining smooth, hydrodynamically efficient hulls (critical for sailboats and racers)
3. **Preventive maintenance**: Monitoring and replacing zinc anodes to prevent electrolysis damage to underwater metal components

### Customer Priorities
- Performance optimization (especially for racers)
- Preventive protection against corrosion
- Convenience of recurring service
- High-quality documentation and transparency

## 3. Service Delivery

### Service Model
- **Recurring subscriptions**: Monthly, bi-monthly, or quarterly intervals (majority of clients)
- **One-time services**: Available but less common
- **Minimum fee**: $150 per visit (waived for some well-maintained smaller boats at $99 max)

### Operational Process
1. **Scheduling**: Automated recurring schedules with email notifications 1-2 weeks in advance
2. **Route optimization**: Clustered service routes based on marina proximity
3. **Equipment**: Custom-built floating platform with battery-powered compressor, electric motor, and hookah diving system
4. **Service time**: Average 30 minutes per boat (range: 5 minutes to 2 hours for largest boats)

### Seasonal Patterns
- **Recurring services**: Consistent year-round due to subscription model
- **New signups**: Slight increase in spring/summer (anecdotal, not data-confirmed)

## 4. Pricing & Revenue

### Pricing Structure
- **Recurring service**: $4.50 per foot of deck length
- **One-time service**: $6.00 per foot of deck length  
- **Anode installation**: $15 labor + ~30% markup on anode cost
- **Minimum visit fee**: $150 (some exceptions at $99)

### Revenue Drivers
- **Willingness to pay**: Driven by reputation and referrals, not price sensitivity
- **Online transparency**: Cost estimator available at sailorskills.com/diving
- **Payment processing**: Stripe for invoicing and payments

## 5. Competition & Differentiation

### Competitive Landscape
- **Local competitors**: Multiple independent divers in Berkeley area
- **Larger operators**: Some hire contractors (technically illegal under California AB5)
- **Market position**: Solo operator with technology advantage

### Key Differentiators
1. **Online cost estimator and sign-up flow** (unique in market)
2. **Digital service logs** with trend analysis over time
3. **4K video documentation** with professional underwater lighting
4. **Recurring subscription model** with automated scheduling
5. **Transparent pricing** and service documentation

## 6. Growth Constraints

### Current Limitations
1. **Operator bandwidth**: Brian's personal willingness to dive (~25-30 hours/month)
2. **Personal preference**: Resistance to repetitive diving work, preference for business development
3. **Geographic focus**: Currently limited to Berkeley Marina for operational efficiency
4. **Market saturation**: Already serving 10% of local marina

### Growth Strategy
- **Hiring plans**: Seeking W-2 employee diver to handle increased workload
- **Technology focus**: Developing SailorSkills Pro app to enable scaling
- **Selective growth**: Willing to add clients within existing marina but not aggressively marketing

## 7. Common Objections & Churn

### Sales Objections
- **Primary reason for "no"**: Already has another diver
- **Secondary reasons**: Cost concerns, DIY preference

### Churn Patterns
- **Natural churn**: Boat sold or relocated to different marina
- **Retention rate**: Extremely high - clients rarely leave for service-related reasons
- **Customer loyalty**: Strong reputation and word-of-mouth referrals maintain client base

## 8. Platform Vision

### SailorSkills Pro App
- **Target users**: Marine service divers
- **Core value**: Eliminates administrative overhead (reduces 10-30 minutes per service to ~60 seconds)
- **Key features**:
  - Voice-based service logging
  - GoPro video integration and automatic labeling
  - Automated service log creation
  - Customer portal updates
  - Automatic billing

### Marketplace Vision
- **Boat owner platform**: AI-assisted boat maintenance and problem-solving
- **Hyper-local content**: Location-specific resources and guidance
- **Service provider matching**: AI-recommended trusted professionals based on boat owner needs
- **Trust network**: Verified professionals using SailorSkills Pro app

## 9. Operational Challenges

### Day-to-Day Pain Points
1. **Personal resistance**: Monotony of repetitive diving work
2. **Administrative overhead**: Despite automation efforts, still requires management
3. **Scaling limitations**: Need to hire before significant expansion
4. **Competitive pressure**: Larger operators using potentially illegal contractor models

### Strategic Priorities
1. **Complete SailorSkills Pro app development**
2. **Hire first W-2 diver employee**
3. **Launch marketplace platform**
4. **Transition from service provider to platform operator**

## 10. Financial Context

### Current State
- **Monthly revenue**: ~$6,400
- **Client count**: ~92 boats
- **Business structure**: S-Corp (since Jan 1, 2025)
- **Payment system**: Stripe + Notion client database

### Operational Efficiency
- **Service density**: High within single marina enables route optimization
- **Equipment**: Custom platform reduces setup/teardown time
- **Automation**: Recurring billing and scheduling minimizes administrative work

## Key Insights for Agent Team

### What Makes SailorSkills Work
1. **Marina community dynamics**: Reputation is everything in tight-knit boating communities
2. **Recurring model stability**: Subscription revenue provides predictability
3. **Technology differentiation**: Digital tools create competitive moat
4. **Operational focus**: Single-location concentration enables efficiency

### What Doesn't Work (Common Misconceptions)
1. **Not a "gig economy" play**: Professional reputation trumps platform convenience
2. **Not geographically expansive**: Efficiency comes from marina concentration
3. **Not price-sensitive**: Quality and reputation drive willingness to pay
4. **Not just hull cleaning**: Anode protection is equally important value proposition

### Strategic Implications
- **Platform development**: Must respect existing marine service culture and relationships
- **Scaling approach**: Hiring divers (W-2) vs. contractor model has legal/ethical dimensions
- **Market expansion**: New marinas require establishing local reputation, not just marketing
- **Technology adoption**: Divers are time-constrained, not tech-averse - solutions must save time, not add complexity
